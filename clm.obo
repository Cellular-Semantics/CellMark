It may contain information that applies to only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nMononuclear phagocytes are immune cells that form a critical part of the body's innate immune system, the body's first line of defense against infections. Mononuclear phagocytes are characterized by the presence of a single, large nucleus. The ‘Mononuclear Phagocyte System’ nomenclature was introduced to distinguish mononuclear monocytes and macrophages from other cells with multiple nuclei. However, the cells within the mononuclear phagocyte system represent a highly heterogeneous group, all of which are able to perform highly efficient phagocytosis - engulfing and digesting microbes and cellular debris to fight infections and to maintain normal tissue homeostasis. \nIn addition to phagocytosis, mononuclear phagocytes also secrete chemical compounds to recruit other immune cells to a site of infection. These cells produce different types of signaling molecules, including cytokines, chemokines, and reactive oxygen species, triggering a cascade of responses to ensure rapid and efficient containment and neutralization of invading pathogens. These cells are also involved in antigen presentation, a process essential for stimulating an adaptive immune response. They can process and present antigens to T cells, thereby linking the innate and adaptive immune responses.\nMononuclear phagocytes play key roles in tissue repair and remodeling. After infection or injury, these cells help in the clearance of dead cells and debris, a crucial step in the initiation of tissue remodeling and the resolution of inflammation. Overall, mononuclear phagocytes are versatile cells that have tailored their functions to meet the unique challenges of different tissues within the body. They are pivotal in homeostasis, immunity, and inflammation, making them important aspects in a range of human diseases including infection, autoimmunity, and cancer." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1016/j.coi.2005.11.008", xref="DOI:10.1038/nri3087", xref="DOI:10.3389/fimmu.2019.01893"}

comment: From FMA: 9.07.2001: Endothelial cell has always been classified as a kind of epithelial cell, specifically a squamous cell but that is not true. First, endothelial cell can either be squamous or cuboidal (e.g. high-endothelial cell) and secondly, it has different embryological derivation (mesodermal) than a true epithelial cell (ectodermal and endodermal). The basis for present classification is the fact that it comprises the outermost layer or lining of anatomical structures (location-based) but a better structural basis for the differentia is the cytoskeleton of the cell. Endothelial cell has vimentin filaments while an epithelial cell has keratin filaments. [Onard].

They constitute approximately half of the total cells in the human brain and more than half in other parts of the nervous system. Glial cells perform several key functions including, but not limited to, maintaining homeostasis, forming the myelin sheath around the neuron axons, and providing support and nutrition to neurons.\nThese different functions are performed by various glial cell types, including astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia and other specialized types. Astrocytes, for example, are the most abundant glial cells and provide metabolic and nutrient support to neurons, help regulate the extracellular ion and neurotransmitter levels, and play a role in the formation and maintenance of the blood-brain barrier, contributing to the overall homeostasis and functioning of the nervous system. Additionally, astrocytes are involved in synaptic communication and participate in processes such as synaptogenesis and synaptic pruning.\nOligodendrocytes in the central nervous system function to insulate neurons by producing a fatty substance known as myelin. The myelin sheath enhances the speed and efficiency of nerve impulse conduction along the axons. \nMicroglia, the immune cells of the central nervous system, protect neurons from pathogens and clear away dead neurons through phagocytosis, a process also known as cellular eating. They also contribute to the regulation of inflammation in response to signals of tissue damage or infection in the central nervous system by releasing cytokines and other signaling molecules that modulate the immune response.\nDespite their overarching function in the support and protection of neurons, glial cells have also been shown to play significant roles in the pathophysiology of many psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s Disease and multiple sclerosis." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1002/glia.24343", xref="DOI:10.1038/nn1988", xref="DOI:10.1101/cshperspect.a020602", xref="DOI:10.1126/science.aat0473", xref="DOI:10.3389/fncel.2017.00024"}

It may contain information that applies to only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nEnteroendocrine cells are a specialized subset of cells located within the epithelial lining of both the small and large intestines, as well as the stomach and pancreas. Constituting less than 1% of the total population of intestinal cells, they are differentiated from a common intestinal cell progenitor, thus sharing lineage with absorptive and goblet cells of the intestines.\nThe distinct characteristic feature of an enteroendocrine cell is its inherent capacity to synthesize and secrete a plethora of gut hormones such as serotonin, somatostatin, neurotensin, cholecystokinin, secretin, gastric inhibitory peptide, motilin, and glucagon-like peptide-1. Integrated within this complex network of signaling agents, these substances control various aspects of the digestive system. Each enteroendocrine cell has its unique combination of hormones to release, determined by its position along the intestinal tract. Intriguingly, these hormones not only modulate local gut function, including motility, absorption and secretion, but also potentiate distant actions on other systems such as endocrine, nervous and immune and play a role in the feeling of satiety.\nThe release of these hormones from enteroendocrine cells is a highly regulated and dynamic process. The cells are equipped with sensory receptors localized on its luminal side that respond to various stimuli, including changes in nutrient composition, chemical or mechanical changes in the gut lumen, or even signals arising from commensal microbiota. This sensory input stimulates a signaling cascade within the cell, culminating in the release of specific hormones into the interstitial fluid. These hormones then make their way into the bloodstream, acting on their respective target receptors to mediate their duties. The multifunctional characteristics of enteroendocrine cells make them crucial for maintaining gut homeostasis and the overall physiological well being of the body." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1038/s41574-019-0168-8", xref="DOI:10.1111/j.1463-1326.2011.01438.x", xref="DOI:10.1196/annals.1294.001", xref="DOI:10.1210/endrev/bnaa018", xref="DOI:10.7554/elife.78512"}

comment: The neurosecretory cell is neither an ordinary neuron nor an endocrine cell, but a combination of both. Its neuronal features resemble those of ordinary neurons concerning both structure and function. The production of a visible secretory material marks the neurosecretory neuron as a gland cell, and the fact that extractable cellular products act in the manner of hormones places it in the realm of endocrine elements. \n\nThe modern definition of neurosecretion has evolved to include the release of any neuronal secretory product from a neuron. {xref="https://www.clinicalkey.com/#!/content/book/3-s2.0-B9780323555968000073", xref="PMID:5342440"}

It may contain information that applies to only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nHepatocytes are the major cell type constituting 70-80% of the liver's cytoplasmic mass, playing crucial roles in maintaining the body's metabolic homeostasis. Dimensions of mature hepatocytes typically range from 20 to 30 μm in humans, but size may vary depending on their location within the liver lobule. Hepatocytes are characterized by high biosynthetic, enzymatic, and endocytic activity. They contain abundant mitochondria, smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum, peroxisomes, lysosomes, and a large nucleus that is often binucleate. \nThe liver consists of three zones - the periportal Zone 1, midzone 2, and pericentral Zone 3 - which have differential nutrient and oxygen status, and damage susceptibility; hepatocytes in the different zones show signifcant functional heterogeneity ('hepatocyte functional zonation'). Hepatocytes are involved in a multitude of critical functions including the metabolism of lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins, the synthesis of serum proteins (e.g., albumin, transferrin, and lipoproteins), the detoxification and excretion of endogenous and exogenous substances, the storage of vitamins and minerals, and the production and secretion of bile. \nHeterocytes demonstrate a remarkable regenerative capacity, which enables the liver to recover from injury and loss of tissue mass. Notably, hepatocytes perform biotransformation with both phase I and phase II enzymes, which modify drugs, xenobiotics, and various substances for elimination from the body. Phase I enzymes, such as cytochrome P450, catalyze both oxidative and reductive reactions of many xenobiotics; many of the products of phase I enzymes are substrates for the phase II enzymes, which catalyze conjugation reactions. \nAlterations in hepatocyte function have significant implications for overall human health and disease. Certain conditions, such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer, can profoundly affect hepatocyte structure and function, thereby disrupting the liver's ability to perform its vital roles within the body. As the primary site for drug metabolism, changes in hepatocyte function can also impact the effectiveness and toxicity of pharmaceuticals. The regenerative ability of hepatocytes makes them valuable cells for liver regenerative medicine and bioartificial liver support systems, and their study has provided significant insights into liver biology and disease." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1016/j.biocel.2011.11.011", xref="DOI:10.1055/s-2007-1007096", xref="DOI:10.1083/jcb.201903090", xref="DOI:10.1111/j.1439-0396.2007.00752.x"}

It may contain information that applies to only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nType D enteroendocrine cells, also known as D or delta cells, are specialized hormone-releasing cells found in the pancreas and also scattered throughout the lining of the gastrointestinal tract in mammals, notably within the stomach and the upper part of the small intestine known as the duodenum. The primary role of D cells is to produce and secrete somatostatin, a potent paracrine inhibitor. \nIn the gastrointestinal tract, somatostatin slows down digestion. It reduces gastric acid secretion and slows down the rate of gastric emptying, thereby prolonging and controling the digestive p. Functionally, these effects are aimed at sustaining nutrient absorption to optimize energy extraction from consumed food.\nIn the pancreas, D cells maintain a vital role in endocrine regulation. D cells in the pancreatic islands secrete somatostatin to inhibit the release of both insulin and glucagon from type A cells and B cells, glucoregulatory hormones that control blood sugar levels. Hence, D cells contribute considerably to the homeostasis of the body's metabolic processes. It is also noteworthy that dysfunctional D cells or irregular somatostatin signaling has been associated with certain pathologies such as neuroendocrine tumors and gastric ulcers." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1016/j.pharmthera.2015.05.007", xref="DOI:10.1038/s41574-018-0020-6", xref="DOI:10.1093/annonc/mdh216", xref="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/somatostatin-cell"}

They are characterized by specific surface markers including: F4/80-positive, CD11b-/low, CD11c-positive, CD68-positive, sialoadhesin-positive, dectin-1-positive, MR-positive, CX3CR1-negative. These specialized immune cells form a crucial part of the body's defense mechanism, playing important roles in pulmonary health and homeostasis. They are the first line of defense in the pulmonary immune response, acting as scavengers that patrol the alveoli and engulf foreign particles like bacteria, dust, and other debris that enter the lungs through inhalation.\nThe primary function of these alveolar macrophages is phagocytosis, whereby they consume and digest foreign substances, dead cells, and other particulates. In the lung, alveolar macrophages are also responsible for clearing surfactant. Additionally, alveolar macrophages also play an integral role in initiating the immune response, as they secrete several pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that recruit other immune cells to the site of infection or inflammation.\nBeyond their role in host defense, alveolar macrophages contribute to tissue remodeling and wound repair in the lungs, aiding in maintaining lung integrity. They also regulate local inflammation and control the immune response to prevent excessive inflammation that may be harmful. However, an imbalance in the function of alveolar macrophages can contribute to various lung diseases.

It may contain information that applies to only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nAcinar cells are specialized exocrine gland cells that secrete specific enzymes and fluids to aid in digestion. Found primarily in the pancreas and salivary glands, the term acinar is derived from the Latin word 'acinus' which means 'grape'; this is because acinar cells are arranged in a grape-like cluster around small ducts, formulating an acinus structure. \nIn the salivary glands, acinar cells secrete digestive enzymes as well as other substances such as mucus and water. These secretions service the initial stages of the digestive process, preparing the consumed food for onward digestion in the stomach and intestines by lubricating and partially breaking it down. \nIn the pancreas, acinar cells are responsible for synthesizing and secreting a significant amount of digestive enzymes, such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, and amylase. These enzymes are stored in zymogen granules inside the acinar cells until they are dispatched into the small intestine. Once within the small intestine, they break down proteins, carbohydrates, and fats into substances that can be absorbed. This is vital to the effective and efficient digestion and absorption of nutrients from the food we consume. \nAcinar cells have high protein synthesis rates and are susceptible to accumulation of misfolded proteins; the subsequential induction of ER stress is thought to be involved in the development of pancreatitis, a serious inflammatory disease of the exocrine pancreas." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1007/BF00710764", xref="DOI:10.1038/nrgastro.2013.36", xref="DOI:10.1097/MOG.0b013e32832ebfac", xref="DOI:10.1111/prd.12116", xref="DOI:10.1152/physrev.00011.2011"}

These cells are present in various types of epithelial tissues in the human body, including the intestinal tract, endocrine glands, and certain parts of the renal system. \nThere are multiple types of endothelial cell fenestrations. The most common type is found in systemic capillaries of the endocrine tissue (e.g., pancreatic islets), gastrointestinal mucosa, and renal peritubular capillaries. Here, the fenestrated cells have fenestrations in their peripheral cytoplasm with a unique thin and permeable diaphragm that provides a high degree of selectivity, blocking the passage of larger molecules while allowing the free movement of smaller ones. In contrast, other types of fenestrations, such as the discontinuous epithelium of the liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, do not have diaphragms. \nCharacteristically, fenestrated cells play a vital role in the filtering process of body systems. They are a key part of the glomeruli in the kidneys where blood is filtered under high pressure. The fenestrations present in the endothelial cells lining the capillaries of the glomerulus allow the free passage of water and small solute molecules towards the Bowman's capsule, leaving behind larger proteins and cells in the blood, thereby aiding in the filtration and waste removal process. \nIn the endocrine system, fenestrated cells in glandular capillaries allow the prompt release of hormones into the bloodstream. These cells have tightly clustered fenestrations which increase the surface area available for passive diffusion, improving the efficiency of hormone secretion. In villi of the small intestine, these cells increase absorption efficiency, permitting the exchange of water, electrolytes, and nutrients.\nOverall, fenestrated cells contribute immensely to important physiological processes of filtration, absorption, and secretion, primarily connecting our body's circulation system with the surrounding tissues and organs." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1002/ar.1092200109", xref="DOI:10.1016/0306-4522(86)90162-4", xref="DOI:10.1016/j.devcel.2012.11.003", xref="DOI:10.1038/s41467-022-31571-2", xref="DOI:10.1152/ajprenal.90601.2008"}

It may contain information that applies to only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nPP cells, also known as pancreatic polypeptide cells (and previously called F cells or gamma cells), are enteroendocrine cells predominantly found in the islets of Langerhans in the head of the pancreas. They are one of the four main endocrine cell types present in the pancreatic islets, along with type A, B and D cells. PP cells are notable for their production of pancreatic polypeptide, an anorexigenic hormone that modulates food intake and energy homeostasis. \nBy secreting pancreatic polypeptide, PP cells play a significant role in the management of both digestive and appetite regulation. Upon ingestion of food, there is a significant increase in the secretion of pancreatic polypeptide, which then reduces biliary secretion and helps slow down the movement of food through the digestive tract. This allows more time for digestion to take place and nutrients to be absorbed, promoting the efficient use of dietary intake. The pancreatic polypeptide further reduces appetite by interacting with the hypothalamus, the area of the brain responsible for control of hunger.\nGiven their important role in digestion, malfunction or damage to PP cells can lead to a disturbance in the digestive process and contribute to some disease conditions. For example, an overproduction of pancreatic polypeptide can result in conditions such as pancreatic tumors and diabetes. Conversely, an under secretion might contribute to obesity due to impaired dietary control. Furthermore, PP cells may also play a role in the body's energy balance, suggesting their implication in conditions related to energy metabolism." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1016/j.febslet.2014.07.005", xref="DOI:10.1016/j.mce.2015.06.028", xref="DOI:10.1038/s41580-020-00317-7", xref="DOI:10.1210/jc.2003-030630", xref="DOI:10.1369/00221554155835"}

comment: This class encompasses the muscle cells responsible for heart* contraction in both vertebrates and arthropods.  The ultrastucture of a wide range of arthropod heart cells has been examined including spiders, horseshoe crabs, crustaceans (see Sherman, 1973 and refs therein) and insects (see Lehmacher et al (2012) and refs therein).  According to these refs, the cells participating in heart contraction in all cases are transversely striated.  Insects hearts additionally contain ostial cells, also transversely striated muscle cells, but which do not participate in heart contraction.

It may contain information that applies to only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nClassical monocytes are a subtype of monocytes that are characterized by high CD14 but no CD16 expression. Emerging from the bone marrow and entering the bloodstream, these cells play central roles in immune responses and regulation of inflammation. CD14-positive CD16-negative monocytes form the majority of circulating monocytes in the body, typically contributing to around 80-90% of the total monocyte pool. \nThe primary function of the classical monocytes is to serve in the frontline of host defense against infections. They are primed to migrate to sites of infection, and they express pattern recognition receptors that help them identify and phagocytose pathogens, leading to their destruction. Classical monocytes also contribute to inflammation by producing several pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukins and tumor necrosis factors. \nIn response to specific signals from tissues under pathological conditions, such as infection or injury, classical monocytes can leave the bloodstream and migrate towards the affected sites. Following their arrival, these cells differentiate into diverse cell types including macrophages and dendritic cells to combat specific pathogens or injury. Dysregulated monocyte activity can lead to the development of many human diseases including inflammation, infection, tissue injury, and various autoimmune diseases." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1038/nri.2017.28", xref="DOI:10.1111/sji.12883", xref="DOI:10.1182/blood-2009-07-235028", xref="DOI:10.3389/fimmu.2015.00423/full", xref="DOI:10.3389/fimmu.2019.02035"}

It may contain information that applies to only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nPancreatic acinar cells are the functional units of the exocrine pancreas. These cells are structurally arranged in small clusters - or acini - with a small central lumen, and their primary function is to produce and secrete enzymes that facilitate digestion of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats within the small intestine.\nSome of the most important digestive enzymes synthesized by the pancreatic acinar cells include amylase, which digests carbohydrates, lipase, which breaks down fats, and several proteases such as trypsin and chymotrypsin which are vital for the digestion of proteins. Importantly, these enzymes are produced as proenzymes or zymogens to avoid autolysis, or the breakdown of the pancreas itself.\nThe release of these enzymes by the pancreatic acinar cells is strictly regulated by hormones and neurochemicals. Cholecystokinin (CCK) released from the enteroendocrine cells in the duodenum cause the release of these enzymes. Moreover, acinar cells also respond to another hormone, secretin, by releasing bicarbonate-rich fluid which helps to neutralize the gastric acid in the duodenum. \nDysregulation in the function of pancreatic acinar cells can lead to severe health issues, including pancreatitis, which is characterized by inflammatory damage to the organ due to the premature activation of digestive enzymes." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1016/0165-6147(89)90192-2", xref="DOI:10.1038/nrgastro.2013.36", xref="DOI:10.1097/01.mog.0000239863.96833.c0", xref="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK54134/"}

It may contain information that applies to only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nType A enteroendocrine cells, also known as alpha cells or A cells, are a species of endocrine cells primarily located in the pancreatic islets of Langerhans; they have also been identified within the lining of the stomach. Functionally, these cells are pivotal in glucose metabolism and homeostasis, accounting for about 20% of the total population of cells in the pancreatic islets. \nThe primary role of type A enteroendocrine cells involves the synthesis, storage, and secretion of the peptide hormone glucagon, which is critical in energy regulation throughout the body. In response to a decrease in blood glucose levels, the pancreatic A cells are stimulated to secrete glucagon into the bloodstream. Glucagon acts on its target cells, mainly in the liver, to stimulate glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis processes, thereby increasing blood glucose levels back to normal. In this way, pancreatic A cells play an integral role in maintaining glucose homeostasis and preventing hypoglycemia.\nPancreatic A cells also participate in the local regulation of islet activities as glucagon acts through glucagon receptors on A, B and D type cells within the islets. Recent studies have also shown that Pancreatic A cells play a role in the generation and regeneration of B type cells. Following beta cell injuries pancreatic A cells increase in numbers and produce Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which increases the proliferation and cytoprotection of beta cells. In response to extreme injury of B type cells pancreatic A cells can transform (transdifferentiate) into functioning B type cells.\nUntil recently, glucagon has been considered a pancreas-specific hormone; however, extrapancreatic glucagon has been reported in patients who had undergone complete, and glucagon-positive cells been identified in the human stomach, indicating that Type A enteroendocrine cells are not restricted to the pancreas." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1016/j.diabres.2018.06.013", xref="DOI:10.1210/en.2016-1748", xref="DOI:10.2337/db15-1541", xref="DOI:10.2337/dbi19-0002", xref="DOI:10.3389/fphys.2012.00349/full"}

The activity of the Na+/K+ ATPases keeps water and current flowing through the lens from the poles and exiting through the equatorial regions. The cells of the lens epithelium also serve as the progenitors for new lens fibers. It constantly lays down fibers in the embryo, fetus, infant, and adult, and continues to lay down fibers for lifelong growth."

It may contain information that applies to only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nPancreatic polypeptide (PP) cells (also called F or gamma cells) are unique endocrine cells located within the Islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. PP cells are one of the rarer pancreatic cell types and are more prevalent in the head and neck of the pancreas. They are critical in normal pancreatic physiological functions and are involved in the development of pancreatic endocrine disorders.\nThe primary function of PP cells is the production and secretion of the pancreatic polypeptide hormone (PP). This hormone plays a crucial role in several gastrointestinal functions and metabolic responses. The release of the PP hormone is stimulated after eating, especially in protein-rich meals, leading to it being present in large amounts during digestion. The fundamental role of PP is to self-regulate pancreatic secretion activities ensuring its exocrine and endocrine functions are under control.\nThe pancreatic polypeptide hormone from PP cells also aids in adapting to low physical activity and fasting by reducing the production of insulin and glucagon and inhibiting the hepatic glucose production. Additionally, this hormone influences gut motility by slowing down the gastric emptying and reducing small intestinal transit, thereby controlling the pace at which nutritional substances are absorbed. Because of these functions, any malfunction or irregularity in PP cells can result in various disorders such as diabetes and pancreatic diseases." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1016/B978-0-12-819402-7.00001-2", xref="DOI:10.1016/B978-012369442-3/50154-9", xref="DOI:10.1016/j.mce.2015.06.028", xref="DOI:10.1038/s42255-019-0148-2", xref="DOI:10.3389/fendo.2023.1192311"}

Cardiocyte on the other hand is any cell in the heart which includes cells other than muscle cells (e.g. endothelial cell of endocardium). Unless there is a consensus among anatomists that cardiocytes refer only to muscle cells, we will treat them as a general class of cells in the heart.

It may contain information that applies to only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nIntrahepatic cholangiocytes represent a subset of the biliary epithelial cells that form a network of tubes in the liver called the biliary tree The intrahepatic cholangiocytes reside specifically in the intrahepatic bile ducts and play a crucial role in liver physiology and bile production and secretion, thereby aiding in the digestion and absorption of fats in the small intestine. These specific cholangiocytes arise from bipotent hepatoblasts, whereas extrahepatic cholangiocytes share an embryologic origin with the ventral pancreas.\nRecent research suggests that there is also heterogeneity within populations of intrahepatic cholangiocytes with different transcriptional profiles, proliferative capacity, and biological function; for example, subpopulations differ in calcium-mobilizing receptors.\nThe primary function of intrahepatic cholangiocytes is related to bile formation and maintenance of its flow. In addition to their secretory and absorptive activities, they are involved in the regulation of bile composition, volume, and alkalinization, contributing to the neutralization of the acidic chyme (partly digested food) that enters the intestine from the stomach. Intrahepatic cholangiocytes are also recognized for their role in liver regeneration and repair, often proliferating in response to injury. \nIntrahepatic cholangiocytes take part in certain pathological conditions, like primary biliary cirrhosis and cholangiocarcinoma. Changes in these cells often lead to abnormalities in bile formation and transport, causing cholestatic liver diseases. Overall, the primary and secondary functional activities of intrahepatic cholangiocytes are vital in maintaining liver function, digestive processes, and contributing to the body's response to liver injury." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1002/hep.31252", xref="DOI:10.1016/j.ajpath.2023.02.012", xref="DOI:10.1016/j.biocel.2010.06.020", xref="DOI:10.1016/j.gastha.2022.07.015"}

It may contain information that applies to only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nVein endothelial cells form a thin layer of squamous cells, the endothelium, lining the interior surface of veins throughout the body. They shape the inner cellular lining of the entire vascular system, including the heart, playing a crucial role in blood circulation. The unique characteristic compact arrangement of these cells enables veins to act as a barrier between the blood (that can contain foreign substances) and the surrounding venous tissue and maintain the integrity of the vascular system.\nThe primary function of vein endothelial cells is to control the exchange of substances between the bloodstream and the surrounding tissues. They facilitate selective transportation of molecules depending on their size and solubility, including gases, nutrients, hormones, and waste products. Vein endothelial cells also play a protective role by inhibiting the translocation of toxins or pathogens from blood to tissues. Additionally, these cells are involved in blood coagulation and inflammation response, primarily by producing substances that inhibit blood clot formation under normal conditions and initiating clotting when necessary.\nAnother significant function of vein endothelial cells is the regulation of blood flow and blood pressure. They produce and release several substances, including nitric oxide and prostacyclin, which help in controlling vasodilation and vasoconstriction, thereby regulating blood pressure. These cells are also responsible for angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, which is crucial during wound healing and in the formation of granulation tissue. Consequently, any dysfunction in vein endothelial cells can lead to severe health problems like atherosclerosis, hypertension, and thrombosis." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1007/s00441-008-0706-5", xref="DOI:10.1038/s41569-022-00770-1", xref="DOI:10.1038/s41598-021-01360-w", xref="DOI:10.3390/ijms20184411"}

comment: While the term 'multi-ciliated epithelial cell' refers to cells with multiple motile cilia, there are exceptions where epithelial cells may have multiple non-motile cilia. Examples include olfactory sensory neurons, which have non-motile cilia for sensory detection, and choroid plexus epithelial cells, which possess multiple non-motile cilia with transient motility during development. Multiciliated cells are essential for human health, and their dysfunction can lead to various diseases known as ciliopathies, such as primary ciliary dyskinesia. This condition affects the respiratory system, brain ventricles, and reproductive system, leading to chronic respiratory infections, hydrocephalus, and infertility {xref="PMID:22118931", xref="PMID:23959957", xref="PMID:26378583", xref="PMID:25729351"}

It may contain information that applies to only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nThe multi-ciliated epithelial cell are terminally differentiated epithelia that line brain ventricles, the respiratory tract and parts of the female and male reproductive organs in animals, playing critical roles in the maintenance of homeostasis through ciliary motion. They are characterized by the presence of hundreds of motile cilia, hair-like microtubule-based organelles that beat in a coordinated fashion to direct fluid flow over the cell surface.\nMulti-ciliated epithelial cells have fundamental roles in the proper functioning of many organ systems. In the respiratory system, they line the airways and orchestrate the coordinated movement of mucus, effectively clearing the airways of inhaled particles and pathogens. These cells are also vital in the ventricular system of the brain where they facilitate cerebrospinal fluid circulation, thus contributing to the maintenance of the brain's microenvironment. In the fallopian tube, multi-ciliated epithelial cells aid in the transport of oocytes from the ovary to the uterus, a process crucial to reproduction.\nThe formation and function of multi-ciliated epithelial cells is a highly regulated process that involves several stages of development including cell specification, centriole multiplication, and ciliogenesis. Any disruption in these processes can result in dysfunctional or decreased numbers of cilia, which can lead to a myriad of health issues, ranging from chronic respiratory infections to infertility." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1016/j.cub.2014.08.047", xref="DOI:10.1038/nrm.2017.21", xref="DOI:10.1101/cshperspect.a028233"}

It may contain information that applies to only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nHepatoblasts are immature precursor cells that predominate during the early stages of liver development, specifically in the embryonic phase of life. They first arise from the endoderm, one of the three primary germ layers in the very early embryo, and then differentiate into two distinct mature liver cell types - the hepatocytes and cholangiocytes. \nDuring liver organogenesis hepatoblasts proliferate and migrate into the septum transversum to form the liver bud. Proliferation and differentiation of these cells are regulated by several soluble factors, such as hepatocyte growth factor, which is a mitogen of both hepatoblasts and mature hepatocytes. As they start to differentiate into hepatocytes and cholangiocytes, the cells begin to express hepatic markers like albumin and alpha-fetoprotein. \nAlthough hepatoblasts are specified embryonic liver cells that are bipotential for hepatocytes and cholangiocytes, a subset of liver cells (called oval cells) has been identified in adults that express stem cell markers, such as CD133 and cKIT, and has been suggested to have the same potential as hepatoblasts to differentiate into hepatocytes and cholangiocytes." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1016/j.stem.2014.04.010", xref="DOI:10.1093/jb/mvr001", xref="DOI:10.1242/dev.031369", xref="DOI:10.1242/dev.114215", xref="DOI:10.5966/sctm.2015-0051"}

It may contain information that applies to only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nNeural crest cells are a group of transient and highly migratory cells that originate from the neuroectoderm during the early stages of embryonic development. They are multipotent cells with an exceptional degree of plasticity, capable of differentiating into various somatic cell types and therefore play a fundamental role in the formation of various organs and tissues, making them critical contributors to the developing embryo. \nAfter the initiation of neurulation (the formation of the neural tube) neural crest cells start to undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and delaminate and migrate from the dorsal neural tube to several regions throughout the embryo. They differentiate into a range of diverse cell types, such as neurons and glial cells of the peripheral nervous system, including sensory and autonomic neurons. They also contribute to the formation of adrenal glands, pigment cells in the skin (melanocytes), cardiac structures, including parts of the heart septum and major arteries, as well as bones and cartilage of the face and skull.\nDisorders or aberrations in the development or migration of the neural crest cells can lead to serious congenital malformations, such as neurocristopathies, including Hirschsprung disease, neuroblastoma, and neurofibromatosis." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1002/dvg.23276", xref="DOI:10.1242/dev.193193", xref="DOI:10.3389/fcell.2020.00635/full", xref="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2011.12.042"}

Lung neuroendocrine cells are innervated and appear as solitary cells or as clustered masses, localized at airway bifurcation sites, called neuroepithelial bodies that can release serotonin in response to hypoxia and interact with sensory nerve terminals. Lung neuroendocrine cells also function as reserve stem cells that repair the surrounding epithelium after injury." [doi:10.3109/01902148209069653, doi:10.7554/eLife.78216, PMID:33355253]

It may contain information that applies to only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nLung neuroendocrine cells, also commonly known as pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs), are predominantly located in the respiratory epithelium of the bronchial and bronchiolar airways in the lungs. These cells, characterised by their small size and granular appearance, have a distinctive morphology that sets them apart from other lung cells. They are considered part of the diffuse neuroendocrine system due to their scattered distribution through the epithelium and have been classified into solitary cells and clustered forms known as neuroepithelial bodies.\nThe primary function of PNECs is linked to regulation and maintenance of the lung environment. They are sensory in nature and can secrete various bioactive substances such as serotonin, calcitonin, calcitonin gene-related peptides, and bombesin-like peptides which modulate airway smooth muscle tone and influence gut motility. For example, they act as oxygen sensors in response to hypoxia and are responsible for releasing neuropeptides that can induce responses. Moreover, PNECs provide an afferent function as they are equipped with long microvilli that project into the lumen of the bronchus and react to changes in the chemical composition of the luminal content." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1016/bs.ctdb.2018.12.002", xref="DOI:10.1016/j.devcel.2020.09.024", xref="DOI:10.1242/dmm.046920"}

They are at the forefront of sensations and responses to mechanical stimuli, like shear stress and blood pressure changes. An additional key function pertains to the production of nitric oxide, which helps to regulate vascular tone and blood pressure, prevents platelet aggregation, limits leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium, and inhibits smooth muscle cell proliferation. These varied but connected functions help to preclude the development of atherosclerosis, ensuring normal circulation and arterial health.\nMoreover, these cells play a pivotal role in inflammation and coagulation processes. During inflammatory events, they express various adhesion molecules, aiding in leukocyte recruitment and rolling onto the vessel walls for immune response. They also produce anticoagulant and procoagulant substances, involved in blood clotting and clot dissolution, respectively.

It may contain information that applies to only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nCholangiocytes, also known as biliary epithelial cells, are specialized epithelial cells that line the biliary tract, which constitutes the gall bladder and bile ducts inside the liver. Crucial to the maintenance of the liver's health and function, cholangiocytes have a key role in the modification and secretion of bile, a fluid produced by hepatocytes that is essential to digestion and the absorption of fats and vitamins.\nCholangiocytes accomplish their primary function through the expression of a variety of transport proteins located on their apical and basolateral membranes, which propel bile acids and other contents of the bile into the biliary lumen. The hepatic bile, once secreted by the hepatocytes, is further modified by cholangiocytes via secretion and absorption processes. These processes help in the regulation of bile volume and composition, which is fundamental in ensuring the efficient digestion of dietary fats and fat-soluble vitamins and the excretion of cholesterol.\nIn addition to their role in bile modification, cholangiocytes also perform several other integral functions. For instance, these cells express Toll-like receptors (TLRs) which allow cholangiocytes to initiate an immune response against pathogens in the biliary lumen. When functioning normally, these cells contribute to biliary integrity, hepatic architecture, and overall hepatic physiology. However, when they become pathological, they are involved in the progression of liver diseases, such as primary biliary cirrhosis and cholangiocarcinoma – the malignancy of the biliary tract." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1016/j.jcmgh.2015.05.005", xref="DOI:10.1016/j.jhep.2012.10.011", xref="DOI:10.1038/s41575-019-0125-y", xref="DOI:10.1152/ajpgi.00227.2012", xref="DOI:10.5009/gnl16033"}

It may contain information that applies to only to some subtypes and species, and so should not be considered definitional.\n\nMesothelial cells of the pleura form a significant part of the pleural membrane, a thin, double-layered serous membrane that lines the thoracic cavity and encompasses the lungs. These specialized cells contribute to the pleura's key function of producing a lubricating serous fluid, which reduces friction between the lung's outer surface (visceral pleura) and the inner lining of the thoracic cavity (parietal pleura) during respiration. \nThe cellular structure of mesothelial cells, characterized by microvilli on their surface, aids in the secretion and absorption of the pleural fluid, effectively supporting the smooth expansion and contraction of the lungs. Dysregulation in mesothelial cells can lead to pathologies, including pleural effusion and malignant mesothelioma.\nMesothelial cells of the pleura display unique immunologic properties. They act as a first line of defense against infection because they are able to recognize pathogens and respond by secreting various cytokines and chemokines. Additionally, these cells are directly involved in the translocation of immune cells into the pleural cavity during inflammatory response, thereby playing an active role in the immune response within the pleural environment. \nIn the event of pleural injury, these cells are also involved in the mesothelial-mesenchymal transition, a process that allows mesothelial cells to transdifferentiate into myofibroblasts and promote tissue repair." xsd:string {xref="DOI:10.1016/j.ccm.2021.08.005", xref="DOI:10.1016/j.coi.2020.04.005", xref="DOI:10.1152/ajplung.90587.2008", xref="DOI:10.3389/fphys.2014.00284"}

Positioned adjacent to the lung tissue, these cells form a protective barrier and contribute to the structure of the visceral pleura. They are characterized by their cuboidal to squamous epithelial shape and the presence of microvilli on their surface, a feature aiding in fluid and solute exchange between the pleura and the lungs.\nThe primary function of mesothelial cells of visceral pleura is to secrete a lubricating serous fluid to facilitate smooth, frictionless lung movement within the thoracic cavity during respiration. This helps in the prevention of trauma or damage stemming from the constant rubbing of the lung tissue against the chest wall, hence playing a pivotal role in maintaining respiratory function. Besides fluid secretion, these cells have an essential role in the transportation of fluids and particles across the pleura, as well as in inflammation, wound healing, and tissue repair processes within the pleura.\nMesothelial cells of visceral pleura are notably implicated in the development of pleural diseases such as pleural effusion and pleural mesothelioma, a rare and aggressive form of cancer primarily linked with exposure to asbestos.

name: cilium or flagellum-dependent cell motility
def: "Cell motility due to movement of eukaryotic cilia or bacterial-type flagella or archaeal-type flagella." [GOC:cilia, GOC:hjd, GOC:krc]
comment: Note that we deem eukaryotic cilia and microtubule-based flagella to be equivalent, while the bacterial- and archaeal-type flagella have a different structure. The former are microtubule-based structures that lash back and forth and are present only in eukaryotes, while the latter achieve motility by rotation. Bacterial- and archaeal-type flagella are superficially similar but have a different molecular composition and fine structure. These three structures never co-exist in the same organism. Therefore, GO:0001539 'cilium or flagellum-dependent cell motility' is in the subset of terms that should not be used for direct gene product annotation. Instead, select a child term. Direct annotations to GO:0001539 'cilium or flagellum-dependent cell motility' may be amended during annotation QC.

Recombined receptors for antigen encoded by immunoglobulin superfamily domains include T cell receptors and immunoglobulins (antibodies) produced by B cells. The first encounter with antigen elicits a primary immune response that is slow and not of great magnitude. T and B cells selected by antigen become activated and undergo clonal expansion. A fraction of antigen-reactive T and B cells become memory cells, whereas others differentiate into effector cells. The memory cells generated during the primary response enable a much faster and stronger secondary immune response upon subsequent exposures to the same antigen (immunological memory). An example of this is the adaptive immune response found in Mus musculus." [GOC:add, GOC:mtg_sensu, ISBN:0781735149, ISBN:1405196831]

comment: Note that, in addition to forming the root of the molecular function ontology, this term is recommended for the annotation of gene products whose molecular function is unknown. When this term is used for annotation, it indicates that no information was available about the molecular function of the gene product annotated as of the date the annotation was made; the evidence code 'no data' (ND), is used to indicate this. Despite its name, this is not a type of 'function' in the sense typically defined by upper ontologies such as Basic Formal Ontology (BFO). It is instead a BFO:process carried out by a single gene product or complex.

comment: Some transporters, such as certain members of the SLC family, are referred to as 'carriers'; however GO uses carrier with a different meaning: a carrier binds to and transports the substance (see GO:0140104 molecular carrier activity), whereas a transporter forms some pore that allows the passing of molecules.

Exocytosis can occur either by full fusion, when the vesicle collapses into the plasma membrane, or by a kiss-and-run mechanism that involves the formation of a transient contact, a pore, between a granule (for example of chromaffin cells) and the plasma membrane. The latter process most of the time leads to only partial secretion of the granule content. Exocytosis begins with steps that prepare vesicles for fusion with the membrane (tethering and docking) and ends when molecules are secreted from the cell." [GOC:mah, ISBN:0716731363, PMID:22323285]

name: signal transduction
def: "The cellular process in which a signal is conveyed to trigger a change in the activity or state of a cell. Signal transduction begins with reception of a signal (e.g. a ligand binding to a receptor or receptor activation by a stimulus such as light), or for signal transduction in the absence of ligand, signal-withdrawal or the activity of a constitutively active receptor. Signal transduction ends with regulation of a downstream cellular process, e.g. regulation of transcription or regulation of a metabolic process. Signal transduction covers signaling from receptors located on the surface of the cell and signaling via molecules located within the cell. For signaling between cells, signal transduction is restricted to events at and within the receiving cell." [GOC:go_curators, GOC:mtg_signaling_feb11]
comment: Note that signal transduction is defined broadly to include a ligand interacting with a receptor, downstream signaling steps and a response being triggered. A change in form of the signal in every step is not necessary. Note that in many cases the end of this process is regulation of the initiation of transcription. Note that specific transcription factors may be annotated to this term, but core/general transcription machinery such as RNA polymerase should not.

comment: 1. Note that this term is in the subset of terms that should not be used for direct gene product annotation. Instead, select a child term or, if no appropriate child term exists, please request a new term. Direct annotations to this term may be amended during annotation reviews.\n2. While a broader definition of behavior encompassing plants and single cell organisms would be justified on the basis of some usage (see PMID:20160973 for discussion), GO uses a tight definition that limits behavior to animals and to responses involving the nervous system, excluding plant responses that GO classifies under development, and responses of unicellular organisms that has general classifications for covering the responses of cells in multicellular organisms (e.g. cell chemotaxis).

A cell should be considered dead when any one of the following molecular or morphological criteria is met: (1) the cell has lost the integrity of its plasma membrane; (2) the cell, including its nucleus, has undergone complete fragmentation into discrete bodies (frequently referred to as apoptotic bodies). The cell corpse (or its fragments) may be engulfed by an adjacent cell in vivo, but engulfment of whole cells should not be considered a strict criteria to define cell death as, under some circumstances, live engulfed cells can be released from phagosomes (see PMID:18045538)."

comment: This term should not be used for direct annotation, it is currently kept in GO as a placeholder for describing cell death phenotypes in uPHENO.

comment: This term covers any process that negatively regulates the rate of production of a mature gene product, and so includes processes that negatively regulate that rate by reducing the level, stability or availability of intermediates in the process of gene expression. For example, it covers any process that reduces the level, stability or availability of mRNA or circRNA for translation and thereby reduces the rate of production of the encoded protein via translation.

def: "A process which begins when a cell receives an internal or external signal and activates a series of biochemical events (signaling pathway). The process ends with the death of the cell." [GOC:lr, GOC:mtg_apoptosis]
comment: Note that this term should be used to annotate gene products in the organism undergoing the programmed cell death. To annotate genes in another organism whose products modulate programmed cell death in a host organism, consider the term 'modulation by symbiont of host programmed cell death ; GO:0052040'. Also, note that 'programmed cell death ; GO:0012501' should be used to refer to instances of caspase-independent cell death mechanisms, in the absence of further indications on the process taking place. At present, caspase-independent cell death is not yet represented in GO due to the lack of consensus and in-depth research on the topic. 'programmed cell death ; GO:0012501' may also be used to annotate gene products in taxa where apoptosis as defined in GO:0006915 does not occur, such as plants. You may also consider these specific children: GO:0097468 'programmed cell death in response to reactive oxygen species' (with descendants GO:0010421 'hydrogen peroxide-mediated programmed cell death' and GO:0010343 'singlet oxygen-mediated programmed cell death'), and GO:0009626 'plant-type hypersensitive response' and its children.

def: "The series of events required for an organism to receive a painful stimulus, convert it to a molecular signal, and recognize and characterize the signal. Pain is medically defined as the physical sensation of discomfort or distress caused by injury or illness, so can hence be described as a harmful stimulus which signals current (or impending) tissue damage. Pain may come from extremes of temperature, mechanical damage, electricity or from noxious chemical substances. This is a neurological process." [GOC:curators]

name: sexual reproduction
def: "A type of reproduction that combines the genetic material of two gametes (such as a sperm or egg cell or fungal spores). The gametes have an haploid genome (with a single set of chromosomes, the product of a meiotic division) and combines with one another to produce a zygote (diploid)." [Wikipedia:Sexual_reproduction]
comment: Note that gametes may come from two organisms or from a single organism in the case of self-fertilizing hermaphrodites, e.g. C. elegans, or self-fertilization in plants. Note also that sexual reproduction may be seen as the regular alternation, in the life cycle of haplontic, diplontic and diplohaplontic organisms, of meiosis and fertilization which provides for the production offspring. In diplontic organisms there is a life cycle in which the products of meiosis behave directly as gametes, fusing to form a zygote from which the diploid, or sexually reproductive polyploid, adult organism will develop. In diplohaplontic organisms a haploid phase (gametophyte) exists in the life cycle between meiosis and fertilization (e.g. higher plants, many algae and Fungi); the products of meiosis are spores that develop as haploid individuals from which haploid gametes develop to form a diploid zygote; diplohaplontic organisms show an alternation of haploid and diploid generations. In haplontic organisms meiosis occurs in the zygote, giving rise to four haploid cells (e.g. many algae and protozoa), only the zygote is diploid and this may form a resistant spore, tiding organisms over hard times.

In response to the arrival of action potentials, the presynaptic button releases molecules of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. These diffuse across the cleft and transmit the signal to the postsynaptic membrane of the muscle fiber, leading to a change in post-synaptic potential." [GOC:nln]
comment: In vertebrates, the term 'neuromuscular junction' is limited to synapses targeting skeletal muscle fibers - all of which are cholinergic and excitatory. Both inhibitory and excitatory neuromuscular junctions exist in invertebrates, utilizing a range of neurotransmitters including glutamate, GABA and 5-HT.

def: "A stable assembly of two or more macromolecules, i.e. proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates or lipids, in which at least one component is a protein and the constituent parts function together." [GOC:dos, GOC:mah]
comment: A protein complex in this context is meant as a stable set of interacting proteins which can be co-purified by an acceptable method, and where the complex has been shown to exist as an isolated, functional unit in vivo. Acceptable experimental methods include stringent protein purification followed by detection of protein interaction. The following methods should be considered non-acceptable: simple immunoprecipitation, pull-down experiments from cell extracts without further purification, colocalization and 2-hybrid screening. Interactions that should not be captured as protein complexes include: 1) enzyme/substrate, receptor/ligand or any similar transient interactions, unless these are a critical part of the complex assembly or are required e.g. for the receptor to be functional; 2) proteins associated in a pull-down/co-immunoprecipitation assay with no functional link or any evidence that this is a defined biological entity rather than a loose-affinity complex; 3) any complex where the only evidence is based on genetic interaction data; 4) partial complexes, where some subunits (e.g. transmembrane ones) cannot be expressed as recombinant proteins and are excluded from experiments (in this case, independent evidence is necessary to find out the composition of the full complex, if known). Interactions that may be captured as protein complexes include: 1) enzyme/substrate or receptor/ligand if the complex can only assemble and become functional in the presence of both classes of subunits; 2) complexes where one of the members has not been shown to be physically linked to the other(s), but is a homologue of, and has the same functionality as, a protein that has been experimentally demonstrated to form a complex with the other member(s); 3) complexes whose existence is accepted based on localization and pharmacological studies, but for which experimental evidence is not yet available for the complex as a whole.

comment: Depending on the species, this region may have a distinct geometrically shaped electron-dense structure within the axonemal lumen visible in electron microscopy images; most animals don't display this inner structure. The axoneme extends through the ciliary transition zone, but only consists of the outer doublets. The central pair, axonemal spokes, and dynein complexes are not found in this part of the ciliary shaft. Note that the connecting cilium of the photoreceptor cells is thought to be equivalent to the transition zone.

name: synapse
def: "The junction between an axon of one neuron and a dendrite of another neuron, a muscle fiber or a glial cell. As the axon approaches the synapse it enlarges into a specialized structure, the presynaptic terminal bouton, which contains mitochondria and synaptic vesicles. At the tip of the terminal bouton is the presynaptic membrane; facing it, and separated from it by a minute cleft (the synaptic cleft) is a specialized area of membrane on the receiving cell, known as the postsynaptic membrane. In response to the arrival of nerve impulses, the presynaptic terminal bouton secretes molecules of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. These diffuse across the cleft and transmit the signal to the postsynaptic membrane." [GOC:aruk, ISBN:0198506732, PMID:24619342, PMID:29383328, PMID:31998110]

comment: Note that, for example, the formation of a pseudopod in an amoeba would not be considered formation involved in morphogenesis because it would not be thought of as the formation of an anatomical structure that was part of the shaping of the amoeba during its development. The formation of an axon from a neuron would be considered the formation of an anatomical structure involved in morphogenesis because it contributes to the creation of the form of the neuron in a developmental sense.

Note that transport through the nuclear pore complex is not transmembrane because the nuclear membrane is a double membrane and is not traversed. For transport through the nuclear pore, consider instead the term 'nucleocytoplasmic transport ; GO:0006913' and its children. Note also that this term is not intended for use in annotating lateral movement within membranes.

def: "The docking of a cytosolic centriole/basal body to the plasma membrane via the ciliary transition fibers. In some species this may happen via an intermediate step, by first docking to the ciliary vesicle via the ciliary transition fibers. The basal body-ciliary vesicle then relocates to the plasma membrane, followed by the ciliary vesicle fusing with the plasma membrane, effectively attaching the basal body to the plasma membrane." [GOC:cilia, PMID:13978319, PMID:23348840, PMID:23530209, PMID:25686250, PMID:26981235]
comment: Basal bodies in jawed vertebrates appear to first attach to a ciliary vesicle. It is unclear how specific this is to jawed vertebrates or if other organisms also employ this sequence. Some species like Giardia intestinalis do not relocate their basal bodies to the plasma membrane, but have their axonemes extend through the cytosol to then protrude out of the cell to form flagella.

comment: The ion channels through which current flows during an action potential should be annotated to the process 'action potential'. Gene products involved in modulating the characteristics of an action potential via changing the expression levels or the activity of these channels (e.g. modulating their kinetics or voltage sensitivity) should be annotated to this regulation term.

comment: Except in the case of abstracted fiat boundaries such as the midline plane of an organism, all 2D anatomical entities have a 3 dimensional projection. For example, the surface of the shell of a muscle has a distinct shape that projects into the third dimension. Note that boundaries are 2D structures. They have no thickness - and so can not be sites of gene expression or gene product localisation. For this, use boundary region terms.

The innovation of the chambered heart was a key event in vertebrate evolution, because the chambered heart generates one-way blood flow with high pressure, a critical requirement for the efficient blood supply of large-body vertebrates... all extant vertebrates have hearts with two or more chambers (Moorman and Christoffels 2003)" DOI:10.1101/gad.1485706

def: "The retina is the innermost layer or coating at the back of the eyeball, which is sensitive to light and in which the optic nerve terminates." [Wikipedia:Retina, ZFIN:curator]
comment: Currently this class encompasses only verteberate AOs but could in theory also include cephalopod - we may want to make a more specific class for vertebrate retina. note that this class excludes ommatidial retinas, as the retina must be part of an eyeball. Use the parent class photoreceptor array / light-sensitive tissue for arthropods

The lowest part of the oesophagus (ca. 2 cm) is lined with gastric mucosa and covered by peritoneum. The main body of the oesophagus is lined with small, simple mucous glands. Each gland opens into the lumen by a long duct which pierces the muscularis mucosae (Wilson and Washington, 1989). A sphincter is situated at the point where the oesophagus enters the stomach to prevent gastro-oesophageal reflux, i.e. to prevent acidic gastric contents from reaching stratified epithelia of the oesophagus, where they can cause inflammation and irritation (Wilson and Washington, 1989; Brown et al., 1993)."

The neural groove gradually deepens as the neural folds become elevated, and ultimately the folds meet and coalesce in the middle line and convert the groove into a closed tube, the neural tube or neural canal (which strictly speaking is the center of the neural tube), the ectodermal wall of which forms the rudiment of the nervous system.

def: "A complex network of conduits that begins with the canals of Hering (intralobar bile duct) and progressively merges into a system of interlobular, septal, and major ducts which then coalesce to form the extrahepatic bile ducts, which finally deliver bile to the intestine, and in some species to the gallbladder." [DOI:10.1002/ar.20664]
comment: The path in many species is as follows: Bile canaliculi -> Canals of Hering (intralobar bile duct) -> interlobular bile ducts -> intrahepatic bile ducts -> left and right hepatic ducts merge to form -> common hepatic duct *exits liver* and joins -> cystic duct (from gall bladder) forming -> common bile duct -> joins with pancreatic duct -> forming ampulla of Vater -> enters duodenum [WP]

Latest (2010-06-01) new def suggested for GO, added above. Note that EHDAA2 has a more detailed model which we may later adopt. JB: Patterning makes the cushions lay down connective tissue in three domains that force out the local endothelial lining and so the leaflets form

comment: 'brainstem' is a loose term that sometimes refers to the ventral parts o the brain except for any part of the telencephalon - sometimes it includes the diencephalon or subpallial telencephalon structures (ISBN:0471888893). Here we use it in a more restriced sense, to include only the medulla oblongata, pons (when present) and the midbrain tegmentum (following the ZFA definitions).

def: "A flexible rod-shaped body found in embryos of all chordates. It is composed of cells derived from the mesoderm and defines the primitive axis of the embryo. In some chordates, it persists throughout life as the main axial support of the body, while in most vertebrates it becomes the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral disc. The notochord is found ventral to the neural tube." [http://tolweb.org/Chordata/2499, https://github.com/obophenotype/uberon/issues/25, https://github.com/obophenotype/uberon/issues/271, ISBN:0815318960, Wikipedia:Notochord]
comment: The notochord appears early in embryogeny and plays an important role in promoting or organizing the embryonic development of nearby structures. In most adult chordates the notochord disappears or becomes highly modified. In some non-vertebrate chordates and fishes the notochord persists as a laterally flexible but incompressible skeletal rod that prevents telescopic collapse of the body during swimming[TOLWEB]

comment: When the somite becomes segmented from the segmental plate, it is composed of an epithelial sac enclosing mesenchymal somitocoel cells. Thereafter the somite differentiates into two parts, the ventro-medial mesenchymal sclerotome and the dorso-lateral epithelial dermomyotome. This change in the epithelial somite depends on surrounding tissue [PMID:15906248]

comment: WP:Heart states: "The SA node is found in all amniotes but not in more primitive vertebrates. In these animals, the muscles of the heart are relatively continuous and the sinus venosus coordinates the beat which passes in a wave through the remaining chambers. Indeed, since the sinus venosus is incorporated into the right atrium in amniotes, it is likely homologous with the SA node. In teleosts, with their vestigial sinus venosus, the main centre of coordination is, instead, in the atrium.". Note however that ZFA has SA node.

name: blood island
def: "Blood islands are structures in the developing embryo which lead to many different parts of the circulatory system. They primarily derive from plexuses formed from angioblasts. Within them, vacuoles appear through liquefaction of the central part of the syncytium into plasma. The lumen of the blood vessels thus formed is probably intracellular. The flattened cells at the periphery form the endothelium. The nucleated red blood corpuscles develop either from small masses of the original angioblast left attached to the inner wall of the lumen or directly from the flat endothelial cells. In either case the syncytial mass thus formed projects from and is attached to the wall of the vessel. Such a mass is known as a blood island and hemoglobin gradually accumulates within it. Later the cells on the surface round up, giving the mass a mulberry-like appearance. Then the red blood cells break loose and are carried away in the plasma. Such free blood cells continue to divide. Blood islands have been seen in the area vasculosa in the omphalomesenteric vein and arteries, and in the dorsal aorta[WP, unvetted]." [Wikipedia:Blood_island_of_umbilical_vesicle]

The first two nerves supply fibers to the upper limb in addition to their thoracic branches; the next four are limited in their distribution to the parietes of the thorax; the lower five supply the parietes of the thorax and abdomen. The 7th intercostal nerve terminates at the xyphoid process, at the lower end of the sternum. The 10th intercostal nerve terminates at the umbilicus.

def: "The costocervical trunk arises from the upper and back part of the subclavian artery, behind the scalenus anterior on the right side, and medial to that muscle on the left side. Passing backward, it splits into the deep cervical artery and the supreme intercostal artery (or the Highest intercostal artery), which descends behind the pleura in front of the necks of the first and second ribs, and anastomoses with the first aortic intercostal (3rd posterior intercostal artery). As it crosses the neck of the first rib it lies medial to the anterior division of the first thoracic nerve, and lateral to the first thoracic ganglion of the sympathetic trunk. In the first intercostal space, it gives off a branch which is distributed in a manner similar to the distribution of the aortic intercostals. The branch for the second intercostal space usually joins with one from the highest aortic intercostal artery. This branch is not constant, but is more commonly found on the right side; when absent, its place is supplied by an intercostal branch from the aorta. Each intercostal gives off a posterior branch which goes to the posterior vertebral muscles, and sends a small spinal branch through the corresponding intervertebral foramen to the medulla spinalis and its membranes.

comment: Four classes of mineralized tissues are found in vertebrates: bone, cartilage, dentine, and enamel. We think of cartilage and bone as skeletal tissues and of enamel and dentine as dental tissues, but enamel and dentine arose evolutionarily together with bone as skeletal tissues in the dermal skeleton (exoskeleton) of early vertebrates. Scales and teeth of sharks are examples of dermal skeletal elements that are still composed of the three ancient components-enamel, dentine, and bone. Cartilage, on the other hand, provided the basis for the second vertebrate skeletal system, the endoskeleton (Smith and Hall, 1990; Hall, 1998a,b). some invertebrate skeletal tissues have surprisingly bone-like features. Examples include chondrocytes interconnected by cell processes in cephalopod cartilages (Cole and Hall, 2004a,b), and the calcium phosphate layer in the shells of brachiopods (Rodland et al., 2003). However, neither bone nor mineralized cartilage have been found in invertebrates. Editors notes: TODO - develops_from

name: non-neural ectoderm
comment: Gene notes: One of the first genes to be expressed in nonneural ectoderm in amphioxus is BMP2/4 (Panopoulou et al. 1998). BMP2/4 homologues appear to have a very ancient role in distinguishing neural from nonneural ectoderm; in Drosophila as well as in amphioxus and vertebrates, BMP2/4 homologues are expressed in nonneural ectoderm and function in distinguishing neural from nonneural ectoderm (Francois & Bier, 1995 ; Sasai et al. 1995 ; Wilson & Hemmati-Brivanlou, 1995; Panopoulou et al. 1998). A change in level of BMP2/4 from very high in nonneural ectoderm to low in neural ectoderm appears to be a key factor in development of neural crest (Baker & Bronner-Fraser,1997a,1997b;Erickson&Reedy,1998;Marchantet al.1998 ;Selleck et al. 1998).

def: "In the circulatory system of animals, a portal venous system occurs when a capillary bed drains into another capillary bed through veins, without first going through the heart. Both capillary beds and the blood vessels that connect them are considered part of the portal venous system. They are relatively uncommon as the majority of capillary beds drain into veins which then drain into the heart, not into another capillary bed. Portal venous systems are considered venous because the blood vessels that join the two capillary beds are either veins or venules. Examples of such systems include the hepatic portal system and the hypophyseal portal system. Unqualified, 'portal venous system' often refers to the hepatic portal system. For this reason, 'portal vein' most commonly refers to the hepatic portal vein[WP]." [Wikipedia:Portal_venous_system]

comment: The notochordal process grows cranially until it reaches the prechordal plate, the future site of the mouth. In this area the ectoderm is attached directly to the endoderm without intervening mesoderm. This area is known as the oropharyngeal membrane, and it will break down to become the mouth. At the other end of the primitive streak the ectoderm is also fused directly to the endoderm; this is known as the cloacal membrane (proctodeum), or primordial anus.

def: "Multi-tissue structure that is part of the heart tube and will become the cardiac ventricle." [ZFA:0001719]
comment: The embryonic ventricle or primitive ventricle of the developing heart gives rise to the trabeculated parts of the left and right ventricles. In contrast, the smooth parts of the left and right ventricles originate from the embryological bulbus cordis. The primitive ventricle becomes divided by a septum, the septum inferius or ventricular septum, which grows upward from the lower part of the ventricle, its position being indicated on the surface of the heart by a furrow. Its dorsal part increases more rapidly than its ventral portion, and fuses with the dorsal part of the septum intermedium. For a time an interventricular foramen exists above its ventral portion, but this foramen is ultimately closed by the fusion of the aortic septum with the ventricular septum[WP]

def: "The rhombencephalon (or hindbrain) is a developmental categorization of portions of the central nervous system in vertebrates. The rhombencephalon can be subdivided in a variable number of transversal swellings called rhombomeres. In the human embryo eight rhombomeres can be distinguished, from caudal to rostral: Rh7-Rh1 and the isthmus (the most rostral rhombomere). A rare disease of the rhombencephalon, 'rhombencephalosynapsis' is characterized by a missing vermis resulting in a fused cerebellum. Patients generally present with cerebellar ataxia. The caudal rhombencephalon has been generally considered as the initiation site for neural tube closure." [Wikipedia:Rhombencephalon]

It consists of the clavicle and scapula in humans and, in those species with three bones in the pectoral girdle, the coracoid. Some mammalian species (e.g. the dog and the horse) have only the scapula. In humans, the only joints between the shoulder girdle and axial skeleton are the sternoclavicular joints on each side. No joint exists between each scapula and the rib cage; instead the muscular connection between the two permits relatively great mobility of the shoulder girdle in relation to the pelvic girdle. In those species having only the scapula, no joint exists between the forelimb and the thorax, the only attachment being muscular[WP]. Examples: There are only two instances, right and left pectoral girdle skeletons." [Wikipedia:Pectoral_girdle]

comment: The epiblast cells (appearing on day 8 of human embryonic development) make up a columnar epithelium with dense microvilli on the apical surface. During gastrulation, the epiblast cells undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and delaminate to become the loose mesenchyme of the primitive streak. The epiblast is present in postimplantation mouse embryos between E5.5-E7.5.

def: "The hepatic artery proper (also proper hepatic artery), arises from the common hepatic artery and runs alongside the portal vein and the common bile duct to form the portal triad. The hepatic artery proper gives off a small supraduodenal artery to the duodenal bulb. Then the right gastric artery comes off and runs to the left along the lesser curvature of the stomach to meet the left gastric artery, which is a branch of the celiac trunk. It subsequently gives off the cystic artery, which feeds the gallbladder, before bifurcating into the right and left hepatic arteries. Of note, the right and left hepatic arteries may demonstrate variant anatomy. A replaced right hepatic artery may arise from the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and a replaced left hepatic artery may arise from the left gastric artery." [Wikipedia:Hepatic_artery_proper]
