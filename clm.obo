The formation of osteoclasts is influenced by two primary factors: macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and the ligand-activated receptor (RANKL) of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB).\nOsteoclasts also collaborate with osteoblasts, responsible for new bone formation, to maintain bone health and adapt bone structure. Their coordinated actions allow continuous remodeling while preserving overall bone strength and integrity. Imbalances in osteoclast activity can lead to pathological conditions. For example, excessive activity may contribute to diseases like osteoporosis, periprosthetic osteolysis, bone tumors, and Paget's disease. Other the other hand, osteoclast deficiency ca result in conditions like osteopetrosis.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

Mononuclear phagocytes are characterized by the presence of a single, large nucleus. The ‘Mononuclear Phagocyte System’ nomenclature was introduced to distinguish mononuclear monocytes and macrophages from other cells with multiple nuclei. However, the cells within the mononuclear phagocyte system represent a highly heterogeneous group, all of which are able to perform highly efficient phagocytosis - engulfing and digesting microbes and cellular debris to fight infections and to maintain normal tissue homeostasis. \nIn addition to phagocytosis, mononuclear phagocytes also secrete chemical compounds to recruit other immune cells to a site of infection. These cells produce different types of signaling molecules, including cytokines, chemokines, and reactive oxygen species, triggering a cascade of responses to ensure rapid and efficient containment and neutralization of invading pathogens. These cells are also involved in antigen presentation, a process essential for stimulating an adaptive immune response. They can process and present antigens to T cells, thereby linking the innate and adaptive immune responses.\nMononuclear phagocytes play key roles in tissue repair and remodeling. After infection or injury, these cells help in the clearance of dead cells and debris, a crucial step in the initiation of tissue remodeling and the resolution of inflammation. Overall, mononuclear phagocytes are versatile cells that have tailored their functions to meet the unique challenges of different tissues within the body. They are pivotal in homeostasis, immunity, and inflammation, making them important aspects in a range of human diseases including infection, autoimmunity, and cancer.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

Beyond forming the organism's physical exterior, surface ectodermal cells have other significant roles. For instance, these cells lead to the development of the anterior pituitary gland and the enamel of the teeth. They are also integral to the formation of the sensory organs, including the eyes and the ears. In the eyes, they form the cornea and lens epithelium. In the ears, they form the external ear canal and certain parts of the inner ear. Therefore, these cells are instrumental in the development of various sensory systems in an organism.\nCertain abnormalities or mutations in surface ectodermal cells could lead to medical conditions known as ectodermal dysplasias. These are a group of inherited disorders affecting the development or function of teeth, hair, nails, and sweat glands. Therefore, understanding the formation and function of surface ectodermal cells is also important in identifying and addressing certain genetic disorders and conditions. In summary, surface ectodermal cells are essential in embryonic development, contributing to the creation of the external physical appearance and the sensory organs of an organism.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

First, endothelial cell can either be squamous or cuboidal (e.g. high-endothelial cell) and secondly, it has different embryological derivation (mesodermal) than a true epithelial cell (ectodermal and endodermal). The basis for present classification is the fact that it comprises the outermost layer or lining of anatomical structures (location-based) but a better structural basis for the differentia is the cytoskeleton of the cell. Endothelial cell has vimentin filaments while an epithelial cell has keratin filaments. [Onard].

They constitute approximately half of the total cells in the human brain and more than half in other parts of the nervous system. Glial cells perform several key functions including, but not limited to, maintaining homeostasis, forming the myelin sheath around the neuron axons, and providing support and nutrition to neurons.\nThese different functions are performed by various glial cell types, including astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia and other specialized types. Astrocytes, for example, are the most abundant glial cells and provide metabolic and nutrient support to neurons, help regulate the extracellular ion and neurotransmitter levels, and play a role in the formation and maintenance of the blood-brain barrier, contributing to the overall homeostasis and functioning of the nervous system. Additionally, astrocytes are involved in synaptic communication and participate in processes such as synaptogenesis and synaptic pruning.\nOligodendrocytes in the central nervous system function to insulate neurons by producing a fatty substance known as myelin. The myelin sheath enhances the speed and efficiency of nerve impulse conduction along the axons. \nMicroglia, the immune cells of the central nervous system, protect neurons from pathogens and clear away dead neurons through phagocytosis, a process also known as cellular eating. They also contribute to the regulation of inflammation in response to signals of tissue damage or infection in the central nervous system by releasing cytokines and other signaling molecules that modulate the immune response.\nDespite their overarching function in the support and protection of neurons, glial cells have also been shown to play significant roles in the pathophysiology of many psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s Disease and multiple sclerosis.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

They achieve this through the formation of a semi-permeable barrier, in which permeability is regulated by tight junctions; complex structures that bring the cells together, sealing the space between them. This ensures a controlled, selective passage of nutrients, ions, and water from the bloodstream into the gut and vice versa, helping maintain homeostasis and overall health.\nGut endothelial cells also play a significant role in angiogenesis and serve as a critical regulator of the gut immune responses playing a modulative role in gut immune homeostasis and inflammatory responses. In addition, they generate nitric oxide, a potent vasodilator, which helps in maintaining vascular tonus, preventing platelet and leukocyte adhesion, and decreasing smooth muscle proliferation. These multi-faceted roles make gut endothelial cells indispensable for the normal functioning of the gut and overall health.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

The term \"goblet\" refers to their shape, which resembles a flask or goblet, specially at their apical end which is swollen due to the accumulation of secretory granules. \nThe primary function of goblet cells is to to protect and lubricate the underlying tissues by secreting large quantities of mucin, a complex glycoprotein, which forms mucus when hydrated. In the respiratory tract, the mucus secreted by these cells traps dust, bacteria, viruses, and other potentially harmful particles in the inhaled air, preventing them from reaching the delicate tissues of the lungs. In the intestines, the goblet cells secrete mucus that acts as a protective barrier shielding the intestinal epithelium from dietary antigens, pathogens and prevents the intestinal epithelium from being eroded by the actions of the digestive enzymes and the abrasive action of passing food material.\nGoblet cells are capable of rapidly altering their secretory output in response to stimuli. For example, irritants like smoke or dust can trigger an increased rate of mucus production, as the body attempts to flush out the harmful particles. Conversely, in conditions such as chronic bronchitis and cystic fibrosis, overactive goblet cells can create a thick accumulation of mucus that obstructs the airways and fosters bacterial growth. Lastly, goblet cells are not static, rather, they undergo a dynamic process known as goblet cell metaplasia-differentiation, wherein non-goblet cells in response to chronic injury or inflammation, can differentiate into goblet cells leading to an accumulation of these cells in the tissue, known as goblet cell hyperplasia.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

Constituting less than 1% of the total population of intestinal cells, they are differentiated from a common intestinal cell progenitor, thus sharing lineage with absorptive and goblet cells of the intestines.\nThe distinct characteristic feature of an enteroendocrine cell is its inherent capacity to synthesize and secrete a plethora of gut hormones such as serotonin, somatostatin, neurotensin, cholecystokinin, secretin, gastric inhibitory peptide, motilin, and glucagon-like peptide-1. Integrated within this complex network of signaling agents, these substances control various aspects of the digestive system. Each enteroendocrine cell has its unique combination of hormones to release, determined by its position along the intestinal tract. Intriguingly, these hormones not only modulate local gut function, including motility, absorption and secretion, but also potentiate distant actions on other systems such as endocrine, nervous and immune and play a role in the feeling of satiety.\nThe release of these hormones from enteroendocrine cells is a highly regulated and dynamic process. The cells are equipped with sensory receptors localized on its luminal side that respond to various stimuli, including changes in nutrient composition, chemical or mechanical changes in the gut lumen, or even signals arising from commensal microbiota. This sensory input stimulates a signaling cascade within the cell, culminating in the release of specific hormones into the interstitial fluid. These hormones then make their way into the bloodstream, acting on their respective target receptors to mediate their duties. The multifunctional characteristics of enteroendocrine cells make them crucial for maintaining gut homeostasis and the overall physiological well being of the body.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

property_value: dcterms:description "Hepatocytes are the major cell type constituting 70-80% of the liver's cytoplasmic mass, playing crucial roles in maintaining the body's metabolic homeostasis. Dimensions of mature hepatocytes typically range from 20 to 30 μm in humans, but size may vary depending on their location within the liver lobule. Hepatocytes are characterized by high biosynthetic, enzymatic, and endocytic activity. They contain abundant mitochondria, smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum, peroxisomes, lysosomes, and a large nucleus that is often binucleate. \nThe liver consists of three zones - the periportal Zone 1, midzone 2, and pericentral Zone 3 - which have differential nutrient and oxygen status, and damage susceptibility; hepatocytes in the different zones show signifcant functional heterogeneity ('hepatocyte functional zonation'). Hepatocytes are involved in a multitude of critical functions including the metabolism of lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins, the synthesis of serum proteins (e.g., albumin, transferrin, and lipoproteins), the detoxification and excretion of endogenous and exogenous substances, the storage of vitamins and minerals, and the production and secretion of bile. \nHeterocytes demonstrate a remarkable regenerative capacity, which enables the liver to recover from injury and loss of tissue mass. Notably, hepatocytes perform biotransformation with both phase I and phase II enzymes, which modify drugs, xenobiotics, and various substances for elimination from the body. Phase I enzymes, such as cytochrome P450, catalyze both oxidative and reductive reactions of many xenobiotics; many of the products of phase I enzymes are substrates for the phase II enzymes, which catalyze conjugation reactions. \nAlterations in hepatocyte function have significant implications for overall human health and disease. Certain conditions, such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer, can profoundly affect hepatocyte structure and function, thereby disrupting the liver's ability to perform its vital roles within the body. As the primary site for drug metabolism, changes in hepatocyte function can also impact the effectiveness and toxicity of pharmaceuticals. The regenerative ability of hepatocytes makes them valuable cells for liver regenerative medicine and bioartificial liver support systems, and their study has provided significant insights into liver biology and disease.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

property_value: dcterms:description "Skeletal muscle cells, or myocytes, are essential for the musculoskeletal system, featuring a striated appearance from tightly packed sarcomeres. These elongated, multi-nucleated cells convert ATP into mechanical energ and are key for voluntary movement and posture. They also are responsible for maintaining body temperature, storing nutrients, and stabilizing joints.\nSkeletal muscle cells organize themselves tightly into bundles to form muscle fibers. Embedded within each of these cells are thousands of myofibrils, which are made up of the contractile proteins, actin (the thin filament), and myosin (the thick filament). Contraction of a skeletal muscle cell occurs when these myofibrils shorten, a process driven by the sliding of actin and myosin filaments over each other in a mechanism famously known as the sliding filament theory.\nAdditionally, skeletal muscle cells exhibit a high degree of plasticity, which allows for their adaptation in response to alterations in functional demands or damages. They have an innate regenerative capacity due to the presence of satellite cells—quiescent muscle stem cells that reside within the muscle fibers. Upon muscle injury, these satellite cells become activated, proliferate, and differentiate into new muscle cells, thereby contributing to the repair and growth of injured skeletal muscle. With this, skeletal muscle cells serve not only a pivotal biomechanical function but also possess a great capacity for self-healing and regeneration.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

These cells are an essential component of the autonomic nervous system controling involuntary movements within the body.\nSmooth muscle cells play a vital role in many physiological processes due to their unique functionality. They can contract and relax in a slow, sustained, and controlled manner to help modulate the size and shape of the lumens of the organs they surround. For example, in the digestive system, coordinated contraction and relaxation of smooth muscle cells propels food along the gastrointestinal tract - a process known as peristalsis. In the blood vessels, the smooth muscle cells, by contracting or relaxing, either constrict or dilate the vessels, which in turn, help regulate blood flow and pressure.\nOn a cellular level, smooth muscle cells possess a single, centrally located nucleus and contain an arranged network of actin and myosin filaments, which are the proteins responsible for muscle contraction. Unlike their counterparts in skeletal or cardiac muscles, these cells lack specific contact points for these filaments, hence the lack of visible striations. Furthermore, the contraction of smooth muscle cells is regulated by hormones and neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine and norepinephrine, adding an additional layer of complex regulation to these highly specialized cells.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

property_value: dcterms:description "Gametes are reproductive cells essential for sexual reproduction in eukaryotic organisms, including humans, animals, and many plants. These cells are haploid, containing half the genome or only one set of chromosomes, which is a contrast to the diploid state (two sets of chromosomes) found in most cells in a multicellular organism. This reduction in genetic material is crucial since it allows for the re-establishment of the diploid number of chromosomes when two gametes merge to form a diploid zygote during fertilization.\nThere are two major types of gametes in animals: sperm cells in males and egg (or ova) in females. These gametes contribute equally to the genetic makeup of the offspring but are morphologically and functionally distinct. Sperm cells (or spermatozoa) are characterized by their motility, small size, and large quantities; they are produced continuously in vast numbers through a process called spermatogenesis in the male gonads or testes. Female gametes are much larger, fewer in numbers, and are not motile; they undergo a development process known as oogenesis, which takes place within the ovaries. The egg also contributes most of the cytoplasm and organelles (including mitochondria) to the zygote that are required for initial cell division stages after fertilization.\nGametes have a primary role in sexual reproduction and genetic variation, which aids in evolution. The formation of gametes involves a special type of cell division called meiosis that introduces genetic diversity via the process of recombination and independent assortment. Following the fusion of male and female gametes, the combination of paternal and maternal genetic material in the zygote allows for genetic recombination, which is a fundamental source of genetic variation and, thus, evolution. Therefore, gametes not only are critical to the inception of new individuals but also contribute to species survival and evolution.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

Sphincter associated smooth muscle cells play a pivotal role in regulating the opening and closure of the bodily sphincters. These sphincters can be found at multiple locations within the body including the gastrointestinal tract (namely the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and rectum), the urinary tract, and the circulatory system. Upon receiving signals from the autonomous nervous system, these cells contract or relax to modulate the aperture of sphincters, thus controlling the movement of substances through them. Due to their precise and vital functional role, any dysfunction or dysregulation in these cells can lead to serious medical conditions, such as gastroesophageal reflux or urinary incontinence.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

They derive their name from the predominantly smooth appearance under microscopic examination, as opposed to the striated appearance of cardiac and skeletal muscles.  \nA principal function of VSMCs is to regulate vascular tone, which directly dictates blood pressure and blood flow distribution across various body parts. This is achieved through coordinated contraction and relaxation of the muscles in response to a variety of extracellular signals. When a blood vessel is exposed to stimuli like pressure or injury, VSMCs contract, resulting in vasoconstriction and ultimately, an increase in blood pressure. Conversely, in response to vasodilators, these cells relax, leading to vasodilation and a consequent decrease in blood pressure.\nVSMCs are also involved in vascular remodeling, a process where blood vessels adapt their structure to long-term changes in hemodynamic conditions or disease states. In diseases like atherosclerosis and hypertension, an aberrant proliferative and synthetic phenotype of VSMCs contributes to the formation of plaques, leading to vessel hardening or even occlusion. Recent research has further implicated these cells in immune responses, recognizing their function in leukocyte recruitment and inflammation, factors that are largely instrumental in vascular pathologies.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

The primary role of D cells is to produce and secrete somatostatin, a potent paracrine inhibitor. \nIn the gastrointestinal tract, somatostatin slows down digestion. It reduces gastric acid secretion and slows down the rate of gastric emptying, thereby prolonging and controling the digestive p. Functionally, these effects are aimed at sustaining nutrient absorption to optimize energy extraction from consumed food.\nIn the pancreas, D cells maintain a vital role in endocrine regulation. D cells in the pancreatic islands secrete somatostatin to inhibit the release of both insulin and glucagon from type A cells and B cells, glucoregulatory hormones that control blood sugar levels. Hence, D cells contribute considerably to the homeostasis of the body's metabolic processes. It is also noteworthy that dysfunctional D cells or irregular somatostatin signaling has been associated with certain pathologies such as neuroendocrine tumors and gastric ulcers.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

property_value: dcterms:description "A precursor to the smooth muscle cell, the smooth muscle myoblast, is integral to various body systems, including the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and respiratory systems. Smooth muscle myoblasts arise from the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells, a process tightly regulated by specific genetic factors and environmental signals. Their role extends to myogenesis, particularly in the formation of muscular tissue, especially during embryonic development.\nSmooth muscle myoblasts possess distinctive cellular characteristics. In contrast to skeletal muscle myoblasts, they do not fuse to create multinucleated fibers. Instead, they differentiate into individual, uninucleated smooth muscle cells. This differentiation unfolds in two distinct phases: proliferation, marked by rapid division to increase cell numbers, and differentiation, involving structural and functional transformation into mature smooth muscle cells. This intricate process is intricately mediated by various signaling molecules and transcription factors.\nFunctionally, smooth muscle myoblasts and the mature muscle cells they generate play pivotal roles in various physiological processes. Smooth muscle cells orchestrate involuntary muscle responses and are integral to body systems that regulate blood flow, propel food along the digestive tract, and control airflow in the respiratory tract. These diverse functions underscore the significance of smooth muscle myoblasts in the body's growth, maintenance, and overall function.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

These specialized immune cells form a crucial part of the body's defense mechanism, playing important roles in pulmonary health and homeostasis. They are the first line of defense in the pulmonary immune response, acting as scavengers that patrol the alveoli and engulf foreign particles like bacteria, dust, and other debris that enter the lungs through inhalation.\nThe primary function of these alveolar macrophages is phagocytosis, whereby they consume and digest foreign substances, dead cells, and other particulates. In the lung, alveolar macrophages are also responsible for clearing surfactant. Additionally, alveolar macrophages also play an integral role in initiating the immune response, as they secrete several pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that recruit other immune cells to the site of infection or inflammation.\nBeyond their role in host defense, alveolar macrophages contribute to tissue remodeling and wound repair in the lungs, aiding in maintaining lung integrity. They also regulate local inflammation and control the immune response to prevent excessive inflammation that may be harmful. However, an imbalance in the function of alveolar macrophages can contribute to various lung diseases. Abnormal alveolar macrophage activation has been implicated in chronic inflammatory diseases such as emphysema, asthma, and fibrosis.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

These secretions service the initial stages of the digestive process, preparing the consumed food for onward digestion in the stomach and intestines by lubricating and partially breaking it down. \nIn the pancreas, acinar cells are responsible for synthesizing and secreting a significant amount of digestive enzymes, such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, and amylase. These enzymes are stored in zymogen granules inside the acinar cells until they are dispatched into the small intestine. Once within the small intestine, they break down proteins, carbohydrates, and fats into substances that can be absorbed. This is vital to the effective and efficient digestion and absorption of nutrients from the food we consume. \nAcinar cells have high protein synthesis rates and are susceptible to accumulation of misfolded proteins; the subsequential induction of ER stress is thought to be involved in the development of pancreatitis, a serious inflammatory disease of the exocrine pancreas.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

property_value: dcterms:description "Fenestrated cells are specialized epithelial cells that are characterized by a distinctive structural feature, fenestrations or tiny pores, which allow an exchange of substances such as fluids, nutrients, and waste between blood vessels and the surrounding tissue environments. These cells are present in various types of epithelial tissues in the human body, including the intestinal tract, endocrine glands, and certain parts of the renal system. \nThere are multiple types of endothelial cell fenestrations. The most common type is found in systemic capillaries of the endocrine tissue (e.g., pancreatic islets), gastrointestinal mucosa, and renal peritubular capillaries. Here, the fenestrated cells have fenestrations in their peripheral cytoplasm with a unique thin and permeable diaphragm that provides a high degree of selectivity, blocking the passage of larger molecules while allowing the free movement of smaller ones. In contrast, other types of fenestrations, such as the discontinuous epithelium of the liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, do not have diaphragms. \nCharacteristically, fenestrated cells play a vital role in the filtering process of body systems. They are a key part of the glomeruli in the kidneys where blood is filtered under high pressure. The fenestrations present in the endothelial cells lining the capillaries of the glomerulus allow the free passage of water and small solute molecules towards the Bowman's capsule, leaving behind larger proteins and cells in the blood, thereby aiding in the filtration and waste removal process. \nIn the endocrine system, fenestrated cells in glandular capillaries allow the prompt release of hormones into the bloodstream. These cells have tightly clustered fenestrations which increase the surface area available for passive diffusion, improving the efficiency of hormone secretion. In villi of the small intestine, these cells increase absorption efficiency, permitting the exchange of water, electrolytes, and nutrients.\nOverall, fenestrated cells contribute immensely to important physiological processes of filtration, absorption, and secretion, primarily connecting our body's circulation system with the surrounding tissues and organs.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

property_value: dcterms:description "PP cells, also known as pancreatic polypeptide cells (and previously called F cells or gamma cells), are enteroendocrine cells predominantly found in the islets of Langerhans in the head of the pancreas. They are one of the four main endocrine cell types present in the pancreatic islets, along with type A, B and D cells. PP cells are notable for their production of pancreatic polypeptide, an anorexigenic hormone that modulates food intake and energy homeostasis. \nBy secreting pancreatic polypeptide, PP cells play a significant role in the management of both digestive and appetite regulation. Upon ingestion of food, there is a significant increase in the secretion of pancreatic polypeptide, which then reduces biliary secretion and helps slow down the movement of food through the digestive tract. This allows more time for digestion to take place and nutrients to be absorbed, promoting the efficient use of dietary intake. The pancreatic polypeptide further reduces appetite by interacting with the hypothalamus, the area of the brain responsible for control of hunger.\nGiven their important role in digestion, malfunction or damage to PP cells can lead to a disturbance in the digestive process and contribute to some disease conditions. For example, an overproduction of pancreatic polypeptide can result in conditions such as pancreatic tumors and diabetes. Conversely, an under secretion might contribute to obesity due to impaired dietary control. Furthermore, PP cells may also play a role in the body's energy balance, suggesting their implication in conditions related to energy metabolism.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

According to these refs, the cells participating in heart contraction in all cases are transversely striated.  Insects hearts additionally contain ostial cells, also transversely striated muscle cells, but which do not participate in heart contraction.

property_value: dcterms:description "Cardiac muscle cells, also known as cardiomyocytes or cardiac myocytes, are specialized cells that form the heart tissue. These cells are elongated, branched, and contain a single centrally located nucleus. Their anatomy is composed primarily of densely packed myofibrils, which are protein structures that consist of sarcomeres - the fundamental units of muscle contraction. Cardiac muscle cells are united at their ends through specialized junctions known as intercalated discs, which allow the heart to contract in a unified, powerful and rhythmic way.\nFunctionally, cardiac muscle cells are responsible for the heart's consistent pumping action that circulates blood throughout the body. Unlike most cells in the body, cardiac muscle cells spontaneously depolarize and generate action potentials without external stimulation. This unique trait stems from the presence of ion channels in the cells' membrane that allow a cyclic flow of ions across the membrane, which create the electrical impulses necessary for heart contraction. The spread of these electrical signals from one cardiac muscle cell to another - facilitated by the interconnected network made by the intercalated disks - results in a synchronized contraction of the heart muscle.\nUnlike skeletal muscle cells which can tire and need rest, cardiac muscle cells have to work ceaselessly throughout the entire lifespan, without the opportunity for rest, to ensure continuous circulation of blood. This is made possible through the high volume of mitochondria and a constant supply of oxygen from coronary circulation. In conclusion, cardiac muscle cells, through their unique structure and vital functionality, play a pivotal role in sustaining life by providing the means for blood to reach every cell in the body.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

Emerging from the bone marrow and entering the bloodstream, these cells play central roles in immune responses and regulation of inflammation. CD14-positive CD16-negative monocytes form the majority of circulating monocytes in the body, typically contributing to around 80-90% of the total monocyte pool. \nThe primary function of the classical monocytes is to serve in the frontline of host defense against infections. They are primed to migrate to sites of infection, and they express pattern recognition receptors that help them identify and phagocytose pathogens, leading to their destruction. Classical monocytes also contribute to inflammation by producing several pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukins and tumor necrosis factors. \nIn response to specific signals from tissues under pathological conditions, such as infection or injury, classical monocytes can leave the bloodstream and migrate towards the affected sites. Following their arrival, these cells differentiate into diverse cell types including macrophages and dendritic cells to combat specific pathogens or injury. Dysregulated monocyte activity can lead to the development of many human diseases including inflammation, infection, tissue injury, and various autoimmune diseases.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

These immune cells play crucial roles in maintenance and regulation, homeostasis, and disease response, thereby helping in the overall cognitive functioning of an organism. \nThere are different macrophage populations in the CNS, often classified into microglial cells, which reside in the parenchyma, and non-parenchymal macrophages at the interface between the brain and the periphery, including the perivascular spaces, the choroid plexus, and the meninges. CNS macrophages are derived from erythromyeloid progenitors in the yolk sac. CNS macrophages have distinct morphologies: Meningeal and perivascular macrophages have a more elongated shape than microglia, which are characterized by a small cell body with fine processes; in contrast, choroid plexus macrophages typically have a stellate shape.\nMicroglia are the most abundant abundant mononuclear phagocytes and have been shown to play a number of physiological roles, including proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory functions, synaptic pruning and remodeling, and apoptotic cell removal through phagocytosis. Non-parenchymal CAMs primarily support the barrier function against external antigens. Meningeal macrophages have been shown to respond to peripheral microbial challenges and to protect the brain against fatal viral infection.\nCNS macrophages are also involved in the initiation and progression of many neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease as well as multiple sclerosis.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

property_value: dcterms:description "Bone cells, also known as osteocytes, form the building blocks of the skeletal system. They represent the most common type of bone cell, making up approximately 95% of the total bone cell population in mature adult bone tissue. Osteocytes are a stellate shape with numerous long, slender dendritic processes.\nThe formation of bone is a complex process involving the action of osteoclasts - cells that break down and reabsorb old bone, followed by osteoblasts that rebuild the bone. Osteocytes serve as coordinators for these two types of bone cells to ensure a balance in the bone remodeling process, contributing to maintaining both bone strength and mineral homeostasis.\nThe primary functions of osteocytes involve the creation, maintenance, and repair of bone tissue. They ensure that bone remodeling is performed by forming a network within the bone and communicating with other cells to help them respond to mechanical strain and damage.\nA remarkable aspect of osteocytes is their ability to perceive mechanical forces, translating them into biochemical signals that regulate bone remodeling and adaptation. Defects in osteocyte function, aside from other bone cells, have been associated with several bone disorders such as osteoporosis, renal osteodystrophy, and skeletal manifestations of diabetes.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

These cells are structurally arranged in small clusters - or acini - with a small central lumen, and their primary function is to produce and secrete enzymes that facilitate digestion of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats within the small intestine.\nSome of the most important digestive enzymes synthesized by the pancreatic acinar cells include amylase, which digests carbohydrates, lipase, which breaks down fats, and several proteases such as trypsin and chymotrypsin which are vital for the digestion of proteins. Importantly, these enzymes are produced as proenzymes or zymogens to avoid autolysis, or the breakdown of the pancreas itself.\nThe release of these enzymes by the pancreatic acinar cells is strictly regulated by hormones and neurochemicals. Cholecystokinin (CCK) released from the enteroendocrine cells in the duodenum cause the release of these enzymes. Moreover, acinar cells also respond to another hormone, secretin, by releasing bicarbonate-rich fluid which helps to neutralize the gastric acid in the duodenum. \nDysregulation in the function of pancreatic acinar cells can lead to severe health issues, including pancreatitis, which is characterized by inflammatory damage to the organ due to the premature activation of digestive enzymes.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

property_value: dcterms:description "Type A enteroendocrine cells, also known as alpha cells or A cells, are a species of endocrine cells primarily located in the pancreatic islets of Langerhans; they have also been identified within the lining of the stomach. Functionally, these cells are pivotal in glucose metabolism and homeostasis, accounting for about 20% of the total population of cells in the pancreatic islets. \nThe primary role of type A enteroendocrine cells involves the synthesis, storage, and secretion of the peptide hormone glucagon, which is critical in energy regulation throughout the body. In response to a decrease in blood glucose levels, the pancreatic A cells are stimulated to secrete glucagon into the bloodstream. Glucagon acts on its target cells, mainly in the liver, to stimulate glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis processes, thereby increasing blood glucose levels back to normal. In this way, pancreatic A cells play an integral role in maintaining glucose homeostasis and preventing hypoglycemia.\nPancreatic A cells also participate in the local regulation of islet activities as glucagon acts through glucagon receptors on A, B and D type cells within the islets. Recent studies have also shown that Pancreatic A cells play a role in the generation and regeneration of B type cells. Following beta cell injuries pancreatic A cells increase in numbers and produce Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which increases the proliferation and cytoprotection of beta cells. In response to extreme injury of B type cells pancreatic A cells can transform (transdifferentiate) into functioning B type cells.\nUntil recently, glucagon has been considered a pancreas-specific hormone; however, extrapancreatic glucagon has been reported in patients who had undergone complete, and glucagon-positive cells been identified in the human stomach, indicating that Type A enteroendocrine cells are not restricted to the pancreas.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

The endothelium is responsible for maintaining the interior surface of blood vessels, and plays a critical role in ensuring the smooth flow of blood. \nVascular endothelial cells act as a semi-permeable membrane, controlling the passage of materials and the transit of white blood cells into and out of the bloodstream. These cells are also involved in blood coagulation. When a blood vessel is damaged, endothelial cells promote clotting to prevent excessive bleeding and facilitate wound healing. Other functions include regulation of blood pressure and blood volume by releasing vasodilators and vasoconstrictors to either widen or constrict blood vessels, accordingly.\nFurthermore, the endothelial cells are crucial in the formation of new blood vessels, a process known as angiogenesis. This is particularly important in wound healing and the growth of new tissues during development or after injury. In the context of diseases such as cancer, angiogenesis helps facilitate tumor growth by providing nutrients and oxygen.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

A defining feature of these endo-epithelial cells are the tiny hair-like structures covering their surface, known as cilia. The nucleus is located at the base of the cell, and the area above it is rich in mitochondria and well-developed endoplasmic reticulum, both crucial for the energy-intensive process of cilia operation.\nThe primary function of these ciliated cells is to keep the respiratory tract clean via mucociliary clearance or the respiratory escalator. These cells create a two-layered 'coat': The lower \"sol\" layer is watery where the cilia can beat in coordinated waves, and the upper \"gel\" layer is thick and sticky, trapping inhaled particles, such as dust, bacteria, viruses, and other potentially harmful substances. This rhythmical beating of the cilia then moves the mucus and trapped particles upwards and out of the respiratory tract, which is then either coughed out or swallowed.\nDamage or dysfunction of these ciliated cells, as seen in diseases such as primary ciliary dyskinesia, cystic fibrosis, or chronic bronchitis, may lead to reduced or ineffective mucociliary clearance and an increased susceptibility to respiratory infections.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

These cells reside in the epithelial lining of tissue organs such as the respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, and the bile ducts. The name derives from their distinct appearance under the microscope, which resembles a brush due to the dense layer of microvilli protruding into the lumen.\nA key function of brush cells is chemosensation: They express a variety of signaling molecules and receptors that enable them to detect specific chemical stimuli in the environment and act as sensory transducers. Many of these receptors are responsive to luminal content, which makes brush cells vital for regulating and coordinating appropriate physiological responses to changes in these substances. \nRecent research has also elucidated an important role for these cells in immunity. Intestinal brush cells have been found to be the source of a cytokine called interleukin-25, which can initiate type 2 immune responses during parasitic infections. This immune function, along with the chemosensing abilities, signifies that brush cells could serve crucial roles in health and disease, although much research is still required to fully elucidate their myriad roles in physiology and pathology. Overall, brush cells are a versatile cell type, whose distinct morphology and functional capabilities allow them to perform a unique set of functions within the body.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

property_value: dcterms:description "Intestinal crypt stem cells, also known as crypt base columnar cells, are a unique type of cell, characterized by the highly specific marker LGR5, found in the intestinal epithelium. Situated at the bottom of the minute pockets known as crypts of Lieberkühn, these are undifferentiated cells that have the ability to perpetually self-renew, as well as differentiate into various other cell types that constitute the epithelial lining of the intestine. \nThe fundamental role of intestinal crypt stem cells is to provide a constant supply of new cells to maintain the cellular turnover of the intestinal epithelium, a tissue known for rapid self-renewal. These stem cells are nurtured and protected by specialized epithelial and mesenchymal cells, and together constitute the intestinal stem cell niche. \nAn important function of intestinal crypt stem cells is to sustain the balance between cell division and programmed cell death, called apoptosis, to ensure the integrity of the intestinal lining. Given their active proliferation rate, these stem cells initiate the creation of diverse differentiated cell types, including enterocytes (the primary absorptive cells in the intestinal lumen), goblet cells (that produce mucus to protect the epithelial layer), enteroendocrine cells (involved in producing gastrointestinal hormones), and Paneth cells (involved in secreting antimicrobial peptides). This diversity in output regulates the physiological activities of the gut ranging from nutrient absorption, hormone secretion, bacterial balance, to immunity.\nResearch studies suggest that dysregulation in intestinal crypt stem cell proliferation and differentiation is associated with several intestinal disorders including intestinal cancer, and various enteropathies.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

property_value: dcterms:description "Endothelial cells of sinusoids, often referred to as sinusoidal endothelial cells (SECs), are a specialized type of endothelial cell that primarily reside in the capillaries of the liver, spleen, and bone marrow. These cells form the innermost monolayer of the sinusoidal blood vessels, also known as sinusoids, that mediate the exchange of nutrients, metabolites, and waste materials between the blood and the surrounding organ tissue. SECs possess distinctive morphological features including a large, flattened shape, an abundance of fenestrations or pores, and the lack of a continuous basement membrane. These structural characteristics distinguish sinusoidal endothelial cells from other, more regularly structured endothelial cells in the body.\nDue to their special fenestrated structure, SECs facilitate the exchange of macromolecules, like lipoproteins and hyaluronan, between plasma and the surrounding organ parenchymal cells. These fenestrations act like sieves, allowing the passage of substances based on their size and charge. It's noteworthy that the permeability characteristics of SECs can be regulated dynamically according to the body's homeostatic needs. \nBeyond their key role in exchange mechanisms, endothelial cells of sinusoids are involved in several other functions. In the liver, for example, they help in the removal and endocytic degradation of waste macromolecules, immune response, and regulation of liver regeneration. They also participate in the formation and remodeling of blood vessels, a process known as angiogenesis. Additionally, in recent years, it has been discovered that these cells may have a role in disease conditions like cirrhosis and liver cancer.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

PP cells are one of the rarer pancreatic cell types and are more prevalent in the head and neck of the pancreas. They are critical in normal pancreatic physiological functions and are involved in the development of pancreatic endocrine disorders.\nThe primary function of PP cells is the production and secretion of the pancreatic polypeptide hormone (PP). This hormone plays a crucial role in several gastrointestinal functions and metabolic responses. The release of the PP hormone is stimulated after eating, especially in protein-rich meals, leading to it being present in large amounts during digestion. The fundamental role of PP is to self-regulate pancreatic secretion activities ensuring its exocrine and endocrine functions are under control.\nThe pancreatic polypeptide hormone from PP cells also aids in adapting to low physical activity and fasting by reducing the production of insulin and glucagon and inhibiting the hepatic glucose production. Additionally, this hormone influences gut motility by slowing down the gastric emptying and reducing small intestinal transit, thereby controlling the pace at which nutritional substances are absorbed. Because of these functions, any malfunction or irregularity in PP cells can result in various disorders such as diabetes and pancreatic diseases.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

They are keratin-5-positive, nonciliated, cuboidal cells and typically tightly attached to the basement membrane. In humans, the proportion of basal cells in the respiratory epithelium gradually decreases going down the tracheobronchial tree: they represent approximately 34% of the cells in the trachea, 27% in the large airways, and 10% in the small airways, although it is worth noting that there are differences in the compositions of the tracheobronchial epithelia between different species.\nBasal epithelial cells serve as the basal layer of the tracheobronchial epithelium, providing both structural and regenerative support for the epithelial tissue that lines the upper regions of the respiratory tract. They serve as progenitor or stem cells that are capable of differentiating into multiple cell types, such as ciliated and secretory cells. This gives them a central role in homeostatic maintenance of the epithelium, and in repairing damaged epithelium after an injury or during disease. This regenerative capacity is crucial in maintaining the integrity of the tracheobronchial surface, especially given its continual exposure to inhaled irritants and microorganisms. \nIn addition to their primary restorative function, basal epithelial cells are also involved in the initial immune response within the tracheobronchial tree.

They are found within the columnar epithelium lining these organs, which forms a barrier between the internal body and the exterior environment.\nA principal function of the respiratory goblet cell is the production and secretion of mucus, a carbohydrate-rich, viscous and gel-like substance that plays a critical role in trapping dust, bacteria, viruses, and other airborne particles that are inhaled. The mucus secreted by the goblet cells covers the lining of the respiratory tract, effectively catching these particles and preventing them from reaching the lungs and causing infection. Mucus also provides hydration and lubrication to the respiratory tract surfaces, which is important in maintaining the tissue's health and functioning.\nIn addition to their mucus-secreting capabilities, respiratory goblet cells also play a significant role in the body's inflammatory responses. When the respiratory system is exposed to irritants or pathogens, the number and activity of goblet cells often increase, leading to a higher production of mucus. This is a protective response designed to trap and neutralize the harmful substances more effectively. However, in conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma, an overproliferation of goblet cells, also known as goblet cell hyperplasia, can lead to excessive mucus production and airway obstruction.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

One crucial function is peristalsis, where these cells contract in a coordinated manner, generating a wave of contraction and relaxation. This peristaltic movement facilitates the movement of food particles through the digestive tract, playing a vital role in the digestion and absorption processes in animals. Additionally, these cells are responsible for maintaining the tone of gastrointestinal sphincters, controlling passage and preventing one-sided movement of the contents.\nEnteric smooth muscle cells are also involved in local immune responses of the gastrointestinal tract. They can communicate with local immune cells and secrete cytokines or other signaling molecules in response to infectious organisms, which makes them crucial mediocellular players in gastrointestinal homeostasis and response to disease. Their interactions with other cell types, such as neurons, myofibroblasts, and interstitial cells of Cajal, further contribute to these cells' role in maintaining the physiological functions of the gastrointestinal system.

These specific cholangiocytes arise from bipotent hepatoblasts, whereas extrahepatic cholangiocytes share an embryologic origin with the ventral pancreas.\nRecent research suggests that there is also heterogeneity within populations of intrahepatic cholangiocytes with different transcriptional profiles, proliferative capacity, and biological function; for example, subpopulations differ in calcium-mobilizing receptors.\nThe primary function of intrahepatic cholangiocytes is related to bile formation and maintenance of its flow. In addition to their secretory and absorptive activities, they are involved in the regulation of bile composition, volume, and alkalinization, contributing to the neutralization of the acidic chyme (partly digested food) that enters the intestine from the stomach. Intrahepatic cholangiocytes are also recognized for their role in liver regeneration and repair, often proliferating in response to injury. \nIntrahepatic cholangiocytes take part in certain pathological conditions, like primary biliary cirrhosis and cholangiocarcinoma. Changes in these cells often lead to abnormalities in bile formation and transport, causing cholestatic liver diseases.

The primary function of these cells is contraction and relaxation, which enables the regulation of blood flow and pressure in the aorta, and helps in the distribution of oxygen and nutrients throughout the body.\nAdditionally, a critical characteristic of smooth muscle cells is their plasticity. They can undergo phenotypic modulation in response to changes in their environment or vascular injury, switching from a contractile to a synthetic phenotype.

The unique characteristic compact arrangement of these cells enables veins to act as a barrier between the blood (that can contain foreign substances) and the surrounding venous tissue and maintain the integrity of the vascular system.\nThe primary function of vein endothelial cells is to control the exchange of substances between the bloodstream and the surrounding tissues. They facilitate selective transportation of molecules depending on their size and solubility, including gases, nutrients, hormones, and waste products. Vein endothelial cells also play a protective role by inhibiting the translocation of toxins or pathogens from blood to tissues. Additionally, these cells are involved in blood coagulation and inflammation response, primarily by producing substances that inhibit blood clot formation under normal conditions and initiating clotting when necessary.\nAnother significant function of vein endothelial cells is the regulation of blood flow and blood pressure. They produce and release several substances, including nitric oxide and prostacyclin, which help in controlling vasodilation and vasoconstriction, thereby regulating blood pressure. These cells are also responsible for angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, which is crucial during wound healing and in the formation of granulation tissue. Consequently, any dysfunction in vein endothelial cells can lead to severe health problems like atherosclerosis, hypertension, and thrombosis.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

ADSCs also possess immunomodulatory and homeostatic functions: they have the ability to suppress immune responses and provide a therapeutic environment for tissue repair and regeneration, as well as supporting the proliferation of adipocytes and the overall expansion of adipose tissue and contributing to the tissue's ability to react to demands of energy storage and mobilization. Dysfunction of these cells may contribute to metabolic complications observed in obesity and diabetes. \nADSCs have been used for therapeutic applications such as pathological wound healing,  severe refractory acute graft-versus-host disease, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

These cells play a significant role in the healthy functioning of nerves by producing myelin, a fatty substance that forms a coating around nerve fibers. Myelin serves as an insulator and enhances the speed and efficiency of electrical nerve impulses; a single Schwann cell can myelinate a single axon. Myelination starts by the elongation and envelopment of the Schwann cell around the axon, followed by the synthesis and deposition of myelin layers. Some studies suggest that Schwann cells may regulate neuronal action potential, muscular contraction, and the sensitive response. \nWhile Schwann cells are most commonly known for the formation of the myelin sheath, some Schwann cells do not form myelin: Remak Schwann cells, a class of nonmyelinating Schwann cells, ensheath axons with smaller diameter, such as C fiber nociceptors in sciatic nerves and form Remak bundles.\nSchwann cells are found along both motor and sensory neurons and are crucial for the advancement and recovery of peripheral nerve injuries, due to their capacity to support nerve regeneration. In cases of nerve injury, Schwann cells play a vital role in recovery by initiating Wallerian degeneration, a process in which the part of the axon distal to the injury site degrades and is then cleared away. Following this, Schwann cells can guide the regrowth of the nerve, providing a conducive environment for axon regeneration. They remodel themselves into a regenerative phenotype, proliferate, and organize themselves into bands of Büngner that provide physical and chemical guidance for the regrowths of axons. This function of Schwann cells in the repair and regeneration of nervous system highlights their therapeutic potential in peripheral nerve injury treatments.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

They are crucial for maintaining homeostasis in the retinal environment by controlling the exchange of molecules between the blood and the retina. Furthermore, they mediate immune cell trafficking, supporting the immune privilege of the eye by preventing the unrestricted infiltration of inflammatory cells into the retina, thus maintaining ocular health and normal vision.\nThe malfunction or dysfunction of retinal blood vessel endothelial cells is implicated in numerous ocular pathologies, particularly diabetic retinopathy, which is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide.

The unique structure of these cells, defined by fusiform shape and the absence of striations, sets them apart from other muscle cell types, including cardiac and skeletal.\nThe primary function of smooth muscle cells of the pulmonary artery is to regulate the diameter of the pulmonary artery, which in turn controls the flow of blood into the lungs. They accomplish this task through the contraction and relaxation, indicative of vasoconstriction and vasodilation respectively. When these cells contract, the diameter of the artery narrows, leading to reduced blood flow. Conversely, relaxation of these cells widens the artery, facilitating increased blood flow. Such blood flow modulation is crucial for the maintenance of blood pressure and ensuring that the lungs receive an adequate blood supply for efficient oxygen exchange.\nAs a result, abnormal function or proliferation of these cells can contribute to conditions such as pulmonary hypertension, a condition characterized by high blood pressure in the arteries leading to the lungs.

As part of the smooth muscle tissue, bronchial smooth muscle cells are involuntary cells, meaning they function with minimal direct voluntary control. They are characterized by their elongated spindle-shaped structure, with each cell containing a single central nucleus.\nThe primary function of bronchial smooth muscle cells is to control airway diameter, which directly influences the flow of air into and out of the lungs. Muscular contractions and relaxations mediated by these cells enable the bronchi to constrict or expand, facilitating the regulation of respiratory airflow. Additionally, these cells play a pivotal role in immune responses as they produce and release various substances that can instigate or lessen inflammation of airway tissue. Furthermore, bronchial smooth muscle cells can proliferate and lay down collagen and other extracellular matrix proteins, contributing to the structural integrity of the bronchial tubes.\nIn pathological conditions, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the function and biology of bronchial smooth muscle cells change. Asthma, for example, is associated with an abnormal increase in the mass of the bronchial smooth muscles, leading to narrowing of the airways and resultant breathing difficulties.

They make up one third of all respiratory epithelial cells and serve as stem cells as they can transform into different cell types, like goblet cells, ciliated cells, and club cells, when needed for homeostatic maintenance of the epithelial barrier or to repair and restore a healthy cellular environment after injury.\nTheir position at the interface between the internal environment and the external atmosphere makes these cells a first line of defense against air-borne irritants, allergens, and pathogens.

property_value: dcterms:description "Ionocytes are specialized cells predominantly found in the mammalian respiratory and renal systems as well as in the gills, skin, and intestinal tract of fish. These cells play crucial roles in maintaining ion and acid-base homeostasis. Ionocytes demonstrate remarkable plasticity and are able to adapt themselves in response to changes in environmental conditions such as pH, salinity, ion concentration, and temperature.\nThese cells work by selectively absorbing specific ions from the environment, thus maintaining the body's internal ionic balance. The most commonly absorbed ions include sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl-), calcium (Ca2+), and hydrogen (H+). Moreover, ionocytes contribute to acid-base regulation. In response to acidosis or alkalosis, ionocytes can either excrete or retain hydrogen (H+) and bicarbonate (HCO3-) ions to readjust the blood pH. Further, experimental evidence suggests a functional complexity of ionocytes, implying diverse roles beyond ion regulation. Recent research highlights ionocytes' involvement in ammonia excretion and the regulation of extracellular fluid volume, highlighting their contribution to the overall homeostatic process.\nMalfunctioning ionocytes have been implicated in various diseases, including cystic fibrosis which is caused by mutations in the chloride channel CFTR, an ionocyte marker.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

comment: While the term 'multi-ciliated epithelial cell' refers to cells with multiple motile cilia, there are exceptions where epithelial cells may have multiple non-motile cilia. Examples include olfactory sensory neurons, which have non-motile cilia for sensory detection, and choroid plexus epithelial cells, which possess multiple non-motile cilia with transient motility during development. Multiciliated cells are essential for human health, and their dysfunction can lead to various diseases known as ciliopathies, such as primary ciliary dyskinesia. This condition affects the respiratory system, brain ventricles, and reproductive system, leading to chronic respiratory infections, hydrocephalus, and infertility {xref="PMID:22118931", xref="PMID:23959957", xref="PMID:26378583", xref="PMID:25729351"}

They are characterized by the presence of hundreds of motile cilia, hair-like microtubule-based organelles that beat in a coordinated fashion to direct fluid flow over the cell surface.\nMulti-ciliated epithelial cells have fundamental roles in the proper functioning of many organ systems. In the respiratory system, they line the airways and orchestrate the coordinated movement of mucus, effectively clearing the airways of inhaled particles and pathogens. These cells are also vital in the ventricular system of the brain where they facilitate cerebrospinal fluid circulation, thus contributing to the maintenance of the brain's microenvironment. In the fallopian tube, multi-ciliated epithelial cells aid in the transport of oocytes from the ovary to the uterus, a process crucial to reproduction.\nThe formation and function of multi-ciliated epithelial cells is a highly regulated process that involves several stages of development including cell specification, centriole multiplication, and ciliogenesis. Any disruption in these processes can result in dysfunctional or decreased numbers of cilia, which can lead to a myriad of health issues, ranging from chronic respiratory infections to infertility.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

Proliferation and differentiation of these cells are regulated by several soluble factors, such as hepatocyte growth factor, which is a mitogen of both hepatoblasts and mature hepatocytes. As they start to differentiate into hepatocytes and cholangiocytes, the cells begin to express hepatic markers like albumin and alpha-fetoprotein. \nAlthough hepatoblasts are specified embryonic liver cells that are bipotential for hepatocytes and cholangiocytes, a subset of liver cells (called oval cells) has been identified in adults that express stem cell markers, such as CD133 and cKIT, and has been suggested to have the same potential as hepatoblasts to differentiate into hepatocytes and cholangiocytes.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

property_value: dcterms:description "Transit amplifying cells (TACs) represent an intermediate population between stem cells and fully differentiated cells, and can be found in multiple regions such as the colon and the small intestine. The small intestine's efficiency in absorbing nutrients, its protective barrier function, and its innate cellular renewal every few days is largely dependent on the role played by these TACs.\nTACs of the small intestine are primarily present in the crypt-villus structure of the intestine, more specifically in the crypt region. They originate from Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells that reside at the base of the crypts. Following their derivation from stem cells, TACs undergo up to six rounds of rapid division over a 48-72 hour period, effectively amplifying the cell population, hence their name. During this process, they gradually migrate upward along the walls of the crypt from where they differentiate into diverse mature cell types such as enterocytes, goblet cells, and Paneth cells. \nTACs serve as an important element in the homeostasis and regeneration of the intestinal epithelium, amplifying the pool of cells available for differentiation. They also minimize genetic errors during DNA replication by serving as a 'buffer zone' between the long-lived stem cells and the terminal differentiated cells of the gut lining, thus reducing the potential for propagation of mutation-causing defects. Lastly, TACs play an essential part in gastrointestinal tissue repair following injury or inflammation. Their rapid proliferation and subsequent differentiation abilities often help expedite the wound healing process in the intestinal epithelium.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

property_value: dcterms:description "Intestinal crypt stem cells of the small intestine are a type of adult stem cell intimately involved in the continuous replenishment of the intestinal epithelium, the innermost layer of the intestine responsible for nutrient absorption. These cells, located within the crypts of Lieberkühn, are the origin of various cell lineages that make up the functional units of the small intestine. They possess self-renewal ability, an essential feature of stem cells, which allows them to maintain a steady population in the small intestine.\nOne of the critical roles of intestinal crypt stem cells is to drive the continual renewal process taking place in the small intestine every 3-5 days. By proliferating intensively, these cells produce transient amplifying (TA) cells that are characterized by quick division and progressive differentiation. These cells eventually differentiate into specialized cell types, encompassing absorptive enterocytes, mucin-secreting goblet cells, hormone-secreting enteroendocrine cells, and Paneth cells, all of which have essential roles in digestion and nutrient absorption in the small intestine.\nIntestinal crypt stem cells of the small intestine are also play a significant part in injury recovery. Under regular conditions, these cells primarily exist in an active state, facilitating the constant renovation of the gut lining. However, upon injury or loss of regular intestinal crypt stem cells reserve intestinal stem cells, a slow-cycling and radio-resistant population, can be stimulated to take over the duties of active crypt stem cells. Such plasticity provides a powerful regenerative mechanism that ensures the intestinal epithelium's function and structural integrity amidst diverse conditions.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

Intestinal macrophages represent the largest group of macrophages in the body and play a key role as sentinels for pathogen recognition and elimination. Because the gastrointestinal tract is continually exposed to a high antigenic load derived from microbes and food intake, macrophages in the intestines are crucial not only for the gut’s immune defense but also for maintaining gastrointestinal homeostasis, avoiding chronic inflammation despite constantly facing foreign antigens. The phenotypic profiles and cytokine production of intestinal macrophages therefore differ from conventional macrophages elsewhere in the body. \nColon macrophages orchestrate a wide variety of immune responses. They interact with the colon’s microflora thanks to their location in the mucosal layer, thus playing an important role in shaping gut immunity. By presenting antigens, they help to activate and steer an appropriate immune response either by triggering inflammation against harmful pathogens or by supporting tolerance for beneficial microbes. Therefore, disturbances in the colon macrophage population is thought to contribute to colon-related diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and colon cancer. \nThese immune cells are versatile and multifunctional, not just limited to defensive actions. Colon macrophages interact with the enteric nervous system to regulate gut secretion and motility. They also play a crucial role in maintaining colon tissue health and integrity by contributing to tissue repair processes. This occurs either through phagocytosis of dead cells and remnants, or indirectly through the release of growth factor molecules, which stimulate cellular proliferation and differentiation necessary for tissue regeneration.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

They are specialized secretory epithelial cells that are recognized by their characteristic ‘goblet’ or flask-like shape and typically have a distinctive appearance due to the accumulation of secretory vesicles in their cytoplasm.\nThe primary function of goblet cells is the secretion of mucus, which is an essential substance for the protection and successful functioning of the intestinal tract. In the colon, goblet cells continuously renew the inner mucus layer, which is attached and impervious to bacteria (the outer layer of the colon is unattached and is the habitat of commensal bacteria)\nThe mucus secreted by goblet cells is rich in glycoproteins known as mucins, especially MUC2, forming a complex web of molecules that comprises the foundational structure of the mucus layer. It traps and eliminates harmful bacteria, while selectively allowing beneficial microbiota to access the epithelial surface and aid in digestion and nutrient absorption. The mucus layer not only provides a provides a protective barrier against pathogen invasion, as well as mechanical damage, and the erosive effects of digestive enzymes, it also acts as a lubricant to facilitate the passage of food material.\nColon goblet cells are also involved in regulating the local immune response within the gut, maintaining the delicate balance between necessary immune reactions to harmful pathogens and tolerance to beneficial microbiota and dietary substances. Goblet cells can modulate immune responses by presenting antigens to dendritic cells, as well as through the production of immunomodulatory molecules that can alter the behavior of immune cells. When the inner mucus layer of the colon is defective, it might be a pathophysiological mechanism for colitis and infectious diseases.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

They were named for their unique appearance under an electron microscope, which presents a distinctive ‘tuft-like’ morphology. They are characterized by apical microvilli, arranged in an irregular tuft that confers a dome-like shape. These cells comprise only a small fraction of the cells in the epithelial layer of the colon, making them among the least populous cell types in this region.\nTuft cells in the colon primarily function as chemosensory cells that can sense and respond to environmental changes. These cells can detect and respond to microbial metabolites, helping initiate immune responses against potential threats. \nRecent studies have revealed that tuft cells play a role in responding to intestinal parasitic infections. When a gastrointestinal parasite infects the colon, tuft cells are activated and release the cytokine IL-25. This action increases the production of tuft cells and triggers essential Th2 immune responses to expel the parasites. Also, the removal of tuft cells has been linked to increased susceptibility to these infections. However, overactivity of tuft cells has been associated with inflammatory bowel disease, highlighting the need for a delicate balance of tuft cell function to maintain colon homeostasis.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

They are a pivotal component of the heart's microenvironment and play a key role in regulating blood pressure, maintaining cardiac homeostasis, in addition to cooperating with other cardiac cells like cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts in the orchestration of a coordinated heart function.\nCardiac endothelial cells contribute to the each stage of the heart's operation, whether during relaxation or contraction. Cardiac endothelial cells release nitric oxide, a potent vasodilator that regulates blood vessel dilation consequently controlling blood pressure and flow. They also produce a myriad of growth factors that aid in new blood vessel formation, known as angiogenesis, crucially needed for tissue repair and regeneration when the heart undergoes damage, as in cases of myocardial infarction.\nFurthermore, cardiac endothelial cells control the passage of nutrients, hormones, and gases between the bloodstream and the heart tissue, ensuring its complex metabolic demands are met adequately. They serve as a selective barrier, regulating the transit of cells and signaling molecules, thereby playing a pivotal role in inflammatory responses and immune cell trafficking. They also contribute to the maintenance of blood fluidity and clotting balance through a complex interplay of anti-thrombic and pro-thrombic factors.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

They produce connective tissues enveloping muscle fibers, offering vital structural support for optimal muscle contraction. SMFs are integral components of the dynamic and complex microenvironment of muscle tissue, contributing significantly to healthy muscle development and homeostasis.\nSMFs primarily synthesize and secrete extracellular matrix (ECM) components, such as collagen, fibronectin, and proteoglycans. The resulting ECM exhibits mechanical properties that resist tensile forces from muscle contractions, ensuring muscle efficiency. It also crucially transmits force during muscle movement, aids muscle attachment to the skeletal structure, and serves as a scaffold for muscle regeneration and repair. \nFollowing injury, they proliferate and transform into myofibroblasts, aiding wound contraction and depositing new ECM for tissue repair. Additionally, these fibroblasts modulate inflammatory responses by secreting cytokines and interact with other cell types, like immune cells and satellite cells, to coordinate muscle healing. In diseases, an imbalance in SMF activity may lead to conditions such as fibrosis, marked by excessive ECM deposition and impaired muscle function.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

Discovered through novel mapping techniques in 2018, these cells are surprisingly rare, making up less than 2% of the cells in the lung's airway, yet they play an essential role in the airway surface liquid and mucus regulation, a crucial factor in lung health.\nThe main responsibility of the pulmonary ionocyte pertains to the regulation and mobilization of chloride ions. They express a high level of CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator) gene, which encodes a protein channel across the membrane of cells that produce mucus, sweat, saliva, tears, and digestive enzymes. The activity of CFTR regulates the movement of chloride ions and fluids in and out of cells, which helps maintain a balance of fluid in the organs they are expressed in. If CFTR is dysfunctional, it can cause conditions such as cystic fibrosis, characterized by thick, sticky mucus that can clog the lungs and obstruct the pancreas, leading to respiratory and digestive issues.\nThe discovery of this cell type offers new doors to the treatment and further understanding of diseases like cystic fibrosis. Increased understanding of pulmonary ionocytes could contribute to the development of novel therapeutic approaches to manipulate the function of CFTR in the lungs and other organs affected by dysfunctional CFTR.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

Phasic activity manifests as cyclic contraction and relaxation, similar to the behavior seen in gastrointestinal smooth muscle cells, whilst tonic activity resembles vascular smooth muscle cells, maintaining a constant degree of tension. These features enable tracheobronchial smooth muscle cells to constrict the airways in response to various mechanical and chemical stimuli, including allergens, parasympathetic nervous stimulation, changes in gas composition, and cold air, thus protecting the delicate alveoli from potential damage.\nTracheobronchial smooth muscle cells, beyond their contractile function, actively contribute to airway remodeling in conditions like asthma. Their proliferative and synthetic capabilities lead to smooth muscle hypertrophy, hyperplasia, and the production of extracellular matrix components, collectively causing abnormal airway narrowing.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

As part of the lung's epithelial lining, they act as frontline defenders, maintaining lung health and function.\nThe lung goblet cells are densely packed with granules containing mucin glycoproteins, the primary component of mucus. As mucus is produced and secreted, it moves towards the lumen of the lungs where the cilia, hair-like structures of the neighboring ciliated epithelial cells, help to navigate it upwards and out of the respiratory tract. This coordinated action ensures the expulsion of unwanted particles and pathogens, effectively cleaning the respiratory tract.\nDysfunction or abnormal proliferation of lung goblet cells can result in pathological conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) and asthma, where excessive mucus production leads to airway obstruction. Furthermore, lung goblet cells respond to a variety of stimuli, including toxins, allergens, irritants, and infections, adjusting their mucus production accordingly.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

These cells are a specialized subgroup of smooth muscle cells, specifically found in the layers of the small intestine. The small intestine represents a significant part of the digestive system and plays a crucial role in the absorption of nutrients into the bloodstream.\nSmooth muscle cells of the small intestine are predominantly responsible for creating the contractions and relaxations that constitute intestinal motility. They trigger these movements in a coordinated and rhythmic manner known as peristalsis and segmentation. Peristalsis is a form of longitudinal and sequential contraction that pushes food from the upper gastrointestinal tract to the lower parts. Segmentation works by squeezing the intestine randomly, thereby facilitating the mixing of food particles and increasing contact with absorptive surfaces. These two processes are critical for intestinal motility and an effective digestive process.\nApart from facilitating transit of food through contractions, these smooth muscle cells play a role in controlling the diameter of the vessels and the blood flow in the small intestine by their constrictive ability. These smooth muscle cells also contribute to the structural integrity of the small intestine by forming a part of its muscularis externa and muscularis mucosae. Additionally, they interact with other cell types such as enteric neurons and interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), forming an integrated cellular network that ensures optimal functioning of the intestinal tract.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

property_value: dcterms:description "Bronchial goblet cells are a subset of goblet cells that are predominantly found in the respiratory tract, specifically within the bronchi and bronchioles. Named for their flask-like shape and their apparent similarity to a goblet, these cells contribute significantly to the maintenance of lung health and homeostasis. In humans, goblet cells comprise up to 25% of the bronchial epithelial columnar cells and are an integral part of the mucus-secreting system of the respiratory tract and are primarily responsible for the production and secretion of mucus.\nThe mucus secreted by bronchial goblet cells serves as a protective layer over the delicate and sensitive structures of the bronchi. The mucus, an amalgamation of glycoproteins, lipids, and other substances, traps any inhaled dust, microorganisms, and pollutants, preventing them from reaching deeper lung tissues and causing potential damage. Additionally, the mucus secretion aids in moistening the airway surface, thereby facilitating effective gas exchange and maintaining the overall health of the respiratory tract.\nBronchial goblet cells have an innate defense mechanism wherein they increase secretion of mucus in response to irritants, infection or inflammation in the airway. This strategy, however, if incessantly stimulated, can lead to airway obstruction and health complications like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

property_value: dcterms:description "The large intestine goblet cell is a highly specialized type of mucosal epithelial cell that is located within the epithelial lining of the large intestine. The key function of goblet cells is the production and secretion of a protective layer of mucus which is essential for maintaining gut homeostasis. Goblet cells have a characteristic 'goblet-like' shape, which adapts them for this specific function: organelles such as the nucleus, mitochondria, ER, and Golgi apparatus are located in the basal portion of the cell; while the vesicles with mucins (required for mucus production) are located apically, close to the apical membrane where their exocytosis takes place.\nThe goblet cells of the large intestine produce a thick layer of mucus that coats the intestinal lumen. This mucus provides a barrier that prevents the direct contact of intestinal cells with bacteria and other potentially toxic substances present in the digestive tract. It also lubricates the intestine to facilitate the smooth passage of digested food material. It is worth noting that the mucus system differs between the small and large intestine: although in both the mucus is built around MUC2 mucin polymers produced by goblet cells, it is becoming clear that there are several types of goblet cells that function in different ways. \nFrom an immunological perspective, large intestine goblet cells participate in promoting a balanced gut immune response. They contribute to the process known as immune tolerance, where they prevent the body's immune system from overreacting to the trillions of bacteria present in the gut. These cells achieve this by secreting molecules that help maintain a calm environment, limiting inflammatory reactions unless absolutely necessary. Any dysfunction or decrease in the number of goblet cells can result in a compromised intestinal barrier leading to various health issues, including inflammatory bowel disease.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

Goblet cells are filled with membrane-bound secretory granules, which are responsible for their distinctive, goblet-like shape.\nGoblet cells specialize in the production and secretion of mucus, a slimy substance composed primarily of glycoproteins (mucins) and water. This sticky mucus serves to trap foreign particles and pollutants, such as dust, bacteria, and viruses that an organism breathes in. After trapping these particles, the cilia on neighboring ciliated epithelial cells beat synchronously, forming a coordinated escalator to push mucus upwards toward the pharynx, where it's either swallowed or expectorated. This system, known as the mucociliary clearance or escalator, forms a crucial barrier in the lungs against respiratory pathogens and external insults.\nChanges in the number or function of tracheal goblet cells can engender health complications. For example, goblet cell hyperplasia, or excessive growth of goblet cells, is a common feature of chronic inflammatory lung diseases such as asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).

The fenestration is a crucial feature that allows lipoproteins, nutrients, and other plasma components easy access to hepatocytes for essential liver functions, including clearance of waste products and metabolic regulation.\nHSECs further play a vital role in immune functionality in the liver. They act as a sentinel, determining the nature of the immune response to encountered particulates. They possess a capacity for antigen presentation and express a series of immune-related surface molecules, which helps in immunosurveillance and immunoregulation.

They form a single layer, known as the endothelium, lining the interior surface of arteries, and are able to respond to the high-pressure and flow conditions present in arteries. The primary role of these cells is to provide a barrier between the vessel wall and the blood, exhibiting selective permeability to regulate the movement of liquids, gases, and blood-borne substances across the vascular wall.\nArterial endothelial cells significantly contribute to maintaining vascular homeostasis. They are at the forefront of sensations and responses to mechanical stimuli, like shear stress and blood pressure changes. An additional key function pertains to the production of nitric oxide, which helps to regulate vascular tone and blood pressure, prevents platelet aggregation, limits leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium, and inhibits smooth muscle cell proliferation. These varied but connected functions help to preclude the development of atherosclerosis, ensuring normal circulation and arterial health.\nMoreover, these cells play a pivotal role in inflammation and coagulation processes. During inflammatory events, they express various adhesion molecules, aiding in leukocyte recruitment and rolling onto the vessel walls for immune response. They also produce anticoagulant and procoagulant substances, involved in blood clotting and clot dissolution, respectively. Dysregulation of the usual functions of arterial endothelial cells can result in serious pathophysiological conditions, such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, and other cardiovascular diseases.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

These cells form a ring around the iris, the eye's colored part. Ciliary muscle cells fall into the category of smooth muscle cells, characterized by their lack of the striations typical of skeletal and cardiac muscle cells. Their shape is elongated and pointed at both ends, and they occur in multi-nucleated syncytia where many cells share the same cytoplasm.\nCiliary muscle cells primarily control the eye's accommodation, adjusting the thickness and curvature of the lens to fine-tune the focus of light on the retina. When ciliary muscle cells contract, tension on the zonular fibers holding the lens in place is reduced, allowing the lens to become thicker and increase its refractive power. Conversely, when the ciliary muscle cells relax, the tension on the zonular fibers increases, causing the lens to become flatter and decrease its refractive power. This adjustment facilitates clear vision at different distances, ranging from near to far objects.\nAdditionally, ciliary muscle cells play a role in draining the eye's aqueous humor, which is the clear fluid that fills the anterior chamber of the eye between the cornea and the lens. By controlling the shape of the surrounding trabecular meshwork through muscle contractions and relaxations, ciliary muscle cells indirectly regulate intraocular pressure, a factor critical for preventing ocular conditions like glaucoma.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

Crucial to the maintenance of the liver's health and function, cholangiocytes have a key role in the modification and secretion of bile, a fluid produced by hepatocytes that is essential to digestion and the absorption of fats and vitamins.\nCholangiocytes accomplish their primary function through the expression of a variety of transport proteins located on their apical and basolateral membranes, which propel bile acids and other contents of the bile into the biliary lumen. The hepatic bile, once secreted by the hepatocytes, is further modified by cholangiocytes via secretion and absorption processes. These processes help in the regulation of bile volume and composition, which is fundamental in ensuring the efficient digestion of dietary fats and fat-soluble vitamins and the excretion of cholesterol.\nIn addition to their role in bile modification, cholangiocytes also perform several other integral functions. For instance, these cells express Toll-like receptors (TLRs) which allow cholangiocytes to initiate an immune response against pathogens in the biliary lumen. When functioning normally, these cells contribute to biliary integrity, hepatic architecture, and overall hepatic physiology. However, when they become pathological, they are involved in the progression of liver diseases, such as primary biliary cirrhosis and cholangiocarcinoma – the malignancy of the biliary tract.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

Intestinal enteroendocrine cells exhibit an exceptional diversity, both in terms of their secretory products and their distribution along the intestines, varying from the small intestine to the colon. \nThe primary function of intestinal enteroendocrine cells is to maintain gut physiology and homeostasis. They are known for their hormone production and are the source of numerous bioactive molecules including somatostatin, serotonin, cholecystokinin, glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide, motilin, neurotensin, and others. These hormones and neuropeptides act in autocrine, paracrine, or endocrine signaling, impacting various functions including intestinal motility, secretion, nutrient absorption, and gut barrier functions.\nIntestinal enteroendocrine cells also serve as the body's frontline of defense, playing an integral role in surveillance against lumen-occurring hazards including pathogen attack. Enteroendocrine cells are divided into ‘closed type’ and ‘open type’. Closed type cells are located close to the basal membrane and do not reach the lumen of the gut. In contrast, the apical side of the open-type intestinal enteroendocrine cells is directly exposed to luminal contents and thus can recognize bacterial metabolites and dietary nutrients. In response, these cells can modulate the immune system responses and thereby function as a key communicator between the gut microbiota and the host.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

property_value: dcterms:description "Cerebral cortex endothelial cells are unique endothelial cells responsible for the formation and regulation of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a specialized structure that separates the circulating blood from the cerebral neural tissue. These cells line the inner surface of nearly all blood vessels that irrigate the cerebral cortex, the outermost layer of the brain involved with complex cognitive functions such as thought, perception, and memory formation. Cerebral cortex endothelial cells are integral to maintaining brain health and function due to their role in regulating brain microenvironment and controlling the passage of essential molecules and cells.\nThe endothelial cells in the cerebral cortex are distinctive due to their highly selective permeability, largely attributable to the existence of unique tight junctions which maintain the barrier function of the BBB. The tightly interconnected structures of these cells prevent most substances from freely diffusing into the brain tissue, ensuring that harmful agents such as toxins, pathogens, or peripheral immune cells don't reach the brain and compromise its function. These cells also express multiple transporters and enzymes, allowing the selective entry of necessary nutrients and metabolites while excluding toxic substances.\nCerebral cortex endothelial cells also participate in neurovascular coupling, a process where localized neuronal activity increases cerebral blood flow to satisfy the local metabolic demands. The endothelial cells work in coordination with neurons and other cell types such as astrocytes and pericytes to mediate this process. They have been thought to regulate local blood flow by releasing substances in response to neuronal activity. Additionally, these cells are involved in many pathological conditions. Breakdown or dysfunction of the BBB often marked by altered endothelial cell function is linked to numerous neurological disorders including stroke, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, and brain tumors.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

They perform phagocytosis of pathogens, particulate matter, dead cells, and other cellular debris from the lungs to maintain clear air passages and optimize gas exchange. They may also participate in tissue repair and the resolution of inflammation following injury.\nLung macrophages also play a critical role in immune regulation. They help to initiate an immune response by secreting cytokines and other inflammatory mediators and by presenting antigens from the pathogens they have engulfed to induce T cell responses. However, if activated improperly, lung macrophages can contribute to inflammatory diseases of the lung such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

This is achieved through controlled ion movement across cell membranes, generating rhythmic electrical signals called action potentials. Intercalated discs between these cells aid synchronized contractions by allowing efficient signal spread through gap junctions. The high mitochondrial content ensures a constant energy supply for this ongoing contraction cycle.\nVentricular cardiac muscle cells contribute not only mechanically but also biochemically by secreting essential hormones like atrial natriuretic peptide and B-type natriuretic peptide for blood pressure regulation and cardiac remodeling. These cells exhibit low turnover under normal conditions, emphasizing their long-term stability, yet have limited regenerative capacity following cardiac injuries. Dysfunction in these cells can result in significant cardiac issues, including heart failure.\n\n(This extended description was generated by ChatGPT and reviewed by the CellGuide team, who added references, and by the CL editors, who approved it for inclusion in CL.

Variations in morphology and firing patterns are observed in human cortical VIP interneurons. In a study by Lee et al., 2023, four distinct subtypes of VIP neurons were identified, each exhibiting unique morphologies, soma locations, and electrophysiological properties. These subtypes are defined according to their transcriptomic markers: LBH-VIP and CCD184-VIP, both of which display a bipolar morphology with axons and dendrites extending across cortical layers; and SY16-VIP and ADAMTSL1-VIP, characterized by a dendritic arbor that spreads horizontally within the same layer as the soma (Lee et al., 2023). Disruption or malfunction of VIP cortical interneuron is implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders such as Rett Syndrome and Dravet Syndrome (Goff and Goldberg 2021)." xsd:string {xref="PMID:26420784", xref="PMID:31210267", xref="PMID:33794534", xref="PMID:35221922"}

comment: In the mouse cortex, sst GABAergic cortical interneurons show heterogeneous electrophysiological signatures varying between low-threshold spiking (LTS), regular-spiking and fast-spiking (Song, Y. H., Yoon, J., & Lee, S. H. 2021). Sst GABAergic cortical interneurons have multiple functional roles in the brain. In the mouse, they involved in the generation of slow-waves during the sleep phase of non-rapid eye-movement (NREM) (Funk, C. M. et al., 2017), they maintain synaptic plasticity during motor learning (Adler, A., Zhao, R., et al., 2021), they enhance visual perception in the V1 cortical area by suppressing the activity of pyramidal excitatory neurons (Song, YH. et al., 2020). In humans, malfunctioning of sst GABAergic cortical interneurons is associated with neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia as individuals affected by these pathologies show a decrease of expression of SST in the brain (Song YH., Yoon J. et al., 2021). {xref="PMID:30792151", xref="PMID:33742131", xref="PMID:28821651", xref="PMID:32494634"}

name: tuft cell of stomach
def: "A tuft cell that is part of the epithelium of the stomach. This cell is characterized by gastric chemosensation and immune regulation through IL-25 secretion, which activates ILC2s to produce IL-13, driving epithelial remodelling and tuft cell expansion. Unlike intestinal tuft cells, which are primarily involved in helminth defense and type 2 immunity, the tuft cell of the stomach is primarily involved in inflammation, metaplasia, and hyperplasia."

def: "Any process that results in a change in state or activity of a cell or an organism (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of a stimulus by the chemical structure of the anion portion of a dissociated acid (rather than the acid acting as a proton donor). The acid chemical may be in gaseous, liquid or solid form." [GOC:go_curators, GOC:rn]
comment: This term should be used to describe a response to a specific acid as a chemical. E.g., if an organism were responding to glutamate, then the response would be glutamate-specific; the organism is actually responding to the chemical structure of the anion portion of the dissociated acid. Note that this term is in the subset of terms that should not be used for direct gene product annotation. Instead, select a child term or, if no appropriate child term exists, please request a new term. Direct annotations to this term may be amended during annotation QC.

comment: Note that we deem eukaryotic cilia and microtubule-based flagella to be equivalent, while the bacterial- and archaeal-type flagella have a different structure. The former are microtubule-based structures that lash back and forth and are present only in eukaryotes, while the latter achieve motility by rotation. Bacterial- and archaeal-type flagella are superficially similar but have a different molecular composition and fine structure. These three structures never co-exist in the same organism. Therefore, GO:0001539 'cilium or flagellum-dependent cell motility' is in the subset of terms that should not be used for direct gene product annotation. Instead, select a child term.

Recombined receptors for antigen encoded by immunoglobulin superfamily domains include T cell receptors and immunoglobulins (antibodies) produced by B cells. The first encounter with antigen elicits a primary immune response that is slow and not of great magnitude. T and B cells selected by antigen become activated and undergo clonal expansion. A fraction of antigen-reactive T and B cells become memory cells, whereas others differentiate into effector cells. The memory cells generated during the primary response enable a much faster and stronger secondary immune response upon subsequent exposures to the same antigen (immunological memory). An example of this is the adaptive immune response found in Mus musculus." [GOC:add, GOC:mtg_sensu, ISBN:0781735149, ISBN:1405196831]

comment: Note that, in addition to forming the root of the molecular function ontology, this term is recommended for the annotation of gene products whose molecular function is unknown. When this term is used for annotation, it indicates that no information was available about the molecular function of the gene product annotated as of the date the annotation was made; the evidence code 'no data' (ND), is used to indicate this. Despite its name, this is not a type of 'function' in the sense typically defined by upper ontologies such as Basic Formal Ontology (BFO). It is instead a BFO:process carried out by a single gene product or complex.

name: cellular_component
def: "A location, relative to cellular compartments and structures, occupied by a macromolecular machine. There are three types of cellular components described in the gene ontology: (1) the cellular anatomical entity where a gene product carries out a molecular function (e.g., plasma membrane, cytoskeleton) or membrane-enclosed compartments (e.g., mitochondrion); (2) virion components, where viral proteins act, and (3) the stable macromolecular complexes of which gene product are parts (e.g., the clathrin complex)." [GOC:pdt]
comment: Note that, in addition to forming the root of the cellular component ontology, this term is recommended for the annotation of gene products whose cellular component is unknown. When this term is used for annotation, it indicates that no information was available about the cellular component of the gene product annotated as of the date the annotation was made; the evidence code 'no data' (ND), is used to indicate this.

def: "A specialized eukaryotic organelle that consists of a filiform extrusion of the cell surface and of some cytoplasmic parts. Each cilium is largely bounded by an extrusion of the cytoplasmic (plasma) membrane, and contains a regular longitudinal array of microtubules, anchored to a basal body." [GOC:cilia, GOC:curators, GOC:kmv, GOC:vw, ISBN:0198547684, PMID:16824949, PMID:17009929, PMID:20144998]
comment: Note that we deem cilium and microtubule-based flagellum to be equivalent. In most eukaryotic species, intracellular sub-components of the cilium, such as the ciliary base and rootlet, are located near the plasma membrane. In Diplomonads such as Giardia, instead, the same ciliary parts are located further intracellularly. Also, 'cilium' may be used when axonemal structure and/or motility are unknown, or when axonemal structure is unusual. For all other cases, please refer to children of 'cilium'. Finally, note that any role of ciliary proteins in sensory events should be captured by annotating to relevant biological process terms.

Exocytosis can occur either by full fusion, when the vesicle collapses into the plasma membrane, or by a kiss-and-run mechanism that involves the formation of a transient contact, a pore, between a granule (for example of chromaffin cells) and the plasma membrane. The latter process most of the time leads to only partial secretion of the granule content. Exocytosis begins with steps that prepare vesicles for fusion with the membrane (tethering and docking) and ends when molecules are secreted from the cell." [GOC:mah, ISBN:0716731363, PMID:22323285]

Force generation involves a chemo-mechanical energy conversion step that is carried out by the actin/myosin complex activity, which generates force through ATP hydrolysis. Smooth muscle differs from striated muscle in the much higher actin/myosin ratio, the absence of conspicuous sarcomeres and the ability to contract to a much smaller fraction of its resting length."

name: signal transduction
def: "The cellular process in which a signal is conveyed to trigger a change in the activity or state of a cell. Signal transduction begins with reception of a signal (e.g. a ligand binding to a receptor or receptor activation by a stimulus such as light), or for signal transduction in the absence of ligand, signal-withdrawal or the activity of a constitutively active receptor. Signal transduction ends with regulation of a downstream cellular process, e.g. regulation of transcription or regulation of a metabolic process. Signal transduction covers signaling from receptors located on the surface of the cell and signaling via molecules located within the cell. For signaling between cells, signal transduction is restricted to events at and within the receiving cell." [GOC:go_curators, GOC:mtg_signaling_feb11]
comment: Note that signal transduction is defined broadly to include a ligand interacting with a receptor, downstream signaling steps and a response being triggered. A change in form of the signal in every step is not necessary. Note that in many cases the end of this process is regulation of the initiation of transcription. Note that specific transcription factors may be annotated to this term, but core/general transcription machinery such as RNA polymerase should not.

comment: A neurotransmitter is any of a group of substances that are released on excitation from the axon terminal of a presynaptic neuron of the central or peripheral nervous system and travel across the synaptic cleft to either excite or inhibit the target cell. Among the many substances that have the properties of a neurotransmitter are acetylcholine, noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine, glycine, gamma-aminobutyrate, glutamic acid, substance P, enkephalins, endorphins and serotonin.

comment: 1. Note that this term is in the subset of terms that should not be used for direct gene product annotation. Instead, select a child term or, if no appropriate child term exists, please request a new term. Direct annotations to this term may be amended during annotation reviews.\n2. While a broader definition of behavior encompassing plants and single cell organisms would be justified on the basis of some usage (see PMID:20160973 for discussion), GO uses a tight definition that limits behavior to animals and to responses involving the nervous system, excluding plant responses that GO classifies under development, and responses of unicellular organisms that has general classifications for covering the responses of cells in multicellular organisms (e.g. cell chemotaxis).

A cell should be considered dead when any one of the following molecular or morphological criteria is met: (1) the cell has lost the integrity of its plasma membrane; (2) the cell, including its nucleus, has undergone complete fragmentation into discrete bodies (frequently referred to as apoptotic bodies). The cell corpse (or its fragments) may be engulfed by an adjacent cell in vivo, but engulfment of whole cells should not be considered a strict criteria to define cell death as, under some circumstances, live engulfed cells can be released from phagosomes (see PMID:18045538)."

comment: Note that this term should be used to annotate gene products in the organism undergoing the programmed cell death. To annotate genes in another organism whose products modulate programmed cell death in a host organism, consider the term 'modulation by symbiont of host programmed cell death ; GO:0052040'. Also, note that 'programmed cell death ; GO:0012501' should be used to refer to instances of caspase-independent cell death mechanisms, in the absence of further indications on the process taking place. At present, caspase-independent cell death is not yet represented in GO due to the lack of consensus and in-depth research on the topic. 'programmed cell death ; GO:0012501' may also be used to annotate gene products in taxa where apoptosis as defined in GO:0006915 does not occur, such as plants. You may also consider these specific children: GO:0097468 'programmed cell death in response to reactive oxygen species' (with descendants GO:0010421 'hydrogen peroxide-mediated programmed cell death' and GO:0010343 'singlet oxygen-mediated programmed cell death'), and GO:0009626 'plant-type hypersensitive response' and its children.

name: sexual reproduction
def: "A type of reproduction that combines the genetic material of two gametes (such as a sperm or egg cell or fungal spores). The gametes have an haploid genome (with a single set of chromosomes, the product of a meiotic division) and combines with one another to produce a zygote (diploid)." [Wikipedia:Sexual_reproduction]
comment: Note that gametes may come from two organisms or from a single organism in the case of self-fertilizing hermaphrodites, e.g. C. elegans, or self-fertilization in plants. Note also that sexual reproduction may be seen as the regular alternation, in the life cycle of haplontic, diplontic and diplohaplontic organisms, of meiosis and fertilization which provides for the production offspring. In diplontic organisms there is a life cycle in which the products of meiosis behave directly as gametes, fusing to form a zygote from which the diploid, or sexually reproductive polyploid, adult organism will develop. In diplohaplontic organisms a haploid phase (gametophyte) exists in the life cycle between meiosis and fertilization (e.g. higher plants, many algae and Fungi); the products of meiosis are spores that develop as haploid individuals from which haploid gametes develop to form a diploid zygote; diplohaplontic organisms show an alternation of haploid and diploid generations. In haplontic organisms meiosis occurs in the zygote, giving rise to four haploid cells (e.g. many algae and protozoa), only the zygote is diploid and this may form a resistant spore, tiding organisms over hard times.

comment: In vertebrates, the term 'neuromuscular junction' is limited to synapses targeting skeletal muscle fibers - all of which are cholinergic and excitatory. Both inhibitory and excitatory neuromuscular junctions exist in invertebrates, utilizing a range of neurotransmitters including glutamate, GABA and 5-HT.

def: "A stable assembly of two or more macromolecules, i.e. proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates or lipids, in which at least one component is a protein and the constituent parts function together." [GOC:dos, GOC:mah]
comment: A protein complex in this context is meant as a stable set of interacting proteins which can be co-purified by an acceptable method, and where the complex has been shown to exist as an isolated, functional unit in vivo. Acceptable experimental methods include stringent protein purification followed by detection of protein interaction. The following methods should be considered non-acceptable: simple immunoprecipitation, pull-down experiments from cell extracts without further purification, colocalization and 2-hybrid screening. Interactions that should not be captured as protein complexes include: 1) enzyme/substrate, receptor/ligand or any similar transient interactions, unless these are a critical part of the complex assembly or are required e.g. for the receptor to be functional; 2) proteins associated in a pull-down/co-immunoprecipitation assay with no functional link or any evidence that this is a defined biological entity rather than a loose-affinity complex; 3) any complex where the only evidence is based on genetic interaction data; 4) partial complexes, where some subunits (e.g. transmembrane ones) cannot be expressed as recombinant proteins and are excluded from experiments (in this case, independent evidence is necessary to find out the composition of the full complex, if known). Interactions that may be captured as protein complexes include: 1) enzyme/substrate or receptor/ligand if the complex can only assemble and become functional in the presence of both classes of subunits; 2) complexes where one of the members has not been shown to be physically linked to the other(s), but is a homologue of, and has the same functionality as, a protein that has been experimentally demonstrated to form a complex with the other member(s); 3) complexes whose existence is accepted based on localization and pharmacological studies, but for which experimental evidence is not yet available for the complex as a whole.

comment: Depending on the species, this region may have a distinct geometrically shaped electron-dense structure within the axonemal lumen visible in electron microscopy images; most animals don't display this inner structure. The axoneme extends through the ciliary transition zone, but only consists of the outer doublets. The central pair, axonemal spokes, and dynein complexes are not found in this part of the ciliary shaft. Note that the connecting cilium of the photoreceptor cells is thought to be equivalent to the transition zone.

These diffuse across the cleft and transmit the signal to the postsynaptic membrane." [GOC:aruk, ISBN:0198506732, PMID:24619342, PMID:29383328, PMID:31998110]

Note that transport through the nuclear pore complex is not transmembrane because the nuclear membrane is a double membrane and is not traversed. For transport through the nuclear pore, consider instead the term 'nucleocytoplasmic transport ; GO:0006913' and its children. Note also that this term is not intended for use in annotating lateral movement within membranes.

The cross-talk starts when caspase-8 cleaves Bid and truncated Bid interacts with mitochondria. From this point on it is not possible to distinguish between extrinsic and intrinsic pathways.

comment: In most eukaryotic cells, 'centriole' (GO:0005814) and 'ciliary basal body' (GO:0036064) represent a common entity that cycles through its function in cell division, then ciliogenesis, then cell division again. However, these structures are modified extensively as they transition into each other, and may contain different proteins, specific to each component.

def: "Any process that modulates the frequency, rate or extent of action potential creation, propagation or termination. This typically occurs via modulation of the activity or expression of voltage-gated ion channels." [GOC:dos, GOC:dph, GOC:go_curators, GOC:tb, ISBN:978-0-07-139011-8]
comment: The ion channels through which current flows during an action potential should be annotated to the process 'action potential'. Gene products involved in modulating the characteristics of an action potential via changing the expression levels or the activity of these channels (e.g. modulating their kinetics or voltage sensitivity) should be annotated to this regulation term.

def: "The parasympathetic nervous system is one of the two divisions of the vertebrate autonomic nervous system. Parasympathetic nerves emerge cranially as pre ganglionic fibers from oculomotor, facial, glossopharyngeal and vagus and from the sacral region of the spinal cord. Most neurons are cholinergic and responses are mediated by muscarinic receptors. The parasympathetic system innervates, for example: salivary glands, thoracic and abdominal viscera, bladder and genitalia[GO]." [GO:0048486]

comment: Except in the case of abstracted fiat boundaries such as the midline plane of an organism, all 2D anatomical entities have a 3 dimensional projection. For example, the surface of the shell of a muscle has a distinct shape that projects into the third dimension. Note that boundaries are 2D structures. They have no thickness - and so can not be sites of gene expression or gene product localisation. For this, use boundary region terms.

It lacks chambers and endocardium.... The innovation of the chambered heart was a key event in vertebrate evolution, because the chambered heart generates one-way blood flow with high pressure, a critical requirement for the efficient blood supply of large-body vertebrates... all extant vertebrates have hearts with two or more chambers (Moorman and Christoffels 2003)" DOI:10.1101/gad.1485706

comment: Currently this class encompasses only verteberate AOs but could in theory also include cephalopod - we may want to make a more specific class for vertebrate retina. note that this class excludes ommatidial retinas, as the retina must be part of an eyeball. Use the parent class photoreceptor array / light-sensitive tissue for arthropods

The lowest part of the oesophagus (ca. 2 cm) is lined with gastric mucosa and covered by peritoneum. The main body of the oesophagus is lined with small, simple mucous glands. Each gland opens into the lumen by a long duct which pierces the muscularis mucosae (Wilson and Washington, 1989). A sphincter is situated at the point where the oesophagus enters the stomach to prevent gastro-oesophageal reflux, i.e. to prevent acidic gastric contents from reaching stratified epithelia of the oesophagus, where they can cause inflammation and irritation (Wilson and Washington, 1989; Brown et al., 1993)."

[DOI:10.1002/ar.20664]
comment: The path in many species is as follows: Bile canaliculi -> Canals of Hering (intralobar bile duct) -> interlobular bile ducts -> intrahepatic bile ducts -> left and right hepatic ducts merge to form -> common hepatic duct *exits liver* and joins -> cystic duct (from gall bladder) forming -> common bile duct -> joins with pancreatic duct -> forming ampulla of Vater -> enters duodenum [WP]

comment: GO graph seems to suggest this is an endothelium. WP: The endocardial cushions are thought to arise from a subset of endothelial cells that undergo epithelial to mesenchymal transformation, a process whereby these cells break cell-to-cell contacts and migrate into the cardiac jelly (towards to interior of the heart tube). Latest (2010-06-01) new def suggested for GO, added above. Note that EHDAA2 has a more detailed model which we may later adopt. JB: Patterning makes the cushions lay down connective tissue in three domains that force out the local endothelial lining and so the leaflets form

In some chordates, it persists throughout life as the main axial support of the body, while in most vertebrates it becomes the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral disc. The notochord is found ventral to the neural tube."

comment: The notochord appears early in embryogeny and plays an important role in promoting or organizing the embryonic development of nearby structures. In most adult chordates the notochord disappears or becomes highly modified. In some non-vertebrate chordates and fishes the notochord persists as a laterally flexible but incompressible skeletal rod that prevents telescopic collapse of the body during swimming[TOLWEB]

comment: When the somite becomes segmented from the segmental plate, it is composed of an epithelial sac enclosing mesenchymal somitocoel cells. Thereafter the somite differentiates into two parts, the ventro-medial mesenchymal sclerotome and the dorso-lateral epithelial dermomyotome. This change in the epithelial somite depends on surrounding tissue [PMID:15906248]

comment: WP:Heart states: "The SA node is found in all amniotes but not in more primitive vertebrates. In these animals, the muscles of the heart are relatively continuous and the sinus venosus coordinates the beat which passes in a wave through the remaining chambers. Indeed, since the sinus venosus is incorporated into the right atrium in amniotes, it is likely homologous with the SA node. In teleosts, with their vestigial sinus venosus, the main centre of coordination is, instead, in the atrium.". Note however that ZFA has SA node.

name: blood island
def: "Blood islands are structures in the developing embryo which lead to many different parts of the circulatory system. They primarily derive from plexuses formed from angioblasts. Within them, vacuoles appear through liquefaction of the central part of the syncytium into plasma. The lumen of the blood vessels thus formed is probably intracellular. The flattened cells at the periphery form the endothelium. The nucleated red blood corpuscles develop either from small masses of the original angioblast left attached to the inner wall of the lumen or directly from the flat endothelial cells. In either case the syncytial mass thus formed projects from and is attached to the wall of the vessel. Such a mass is known as a blood island and hemoglobin gradually accumulates within it. Later the cells on the surface round up, giving the mass a mulberry-like appearance. Then the red blood cells break loose and are carried away in the plasma. Such free blood cells continue to divide. Blood islands have been seen in the area vasculosa in the omphalomesenteric vein and arteries, and in the dorsal aorta[WP, unvetted]." [Wikipedia:Blood_island_of_umbilical_vesicle]

The first two nerves supply fibers to the upper limb in addition to their thoracic branches; the next four are limited in their distribution to the parietes of the thorax; the lower five supply the parietes of the thorax and abdomen. The 7th intercostal nerve terminates at the xyphoid process, at the lower end of the sternum. The 10th intercostal nerve terminates at the umbilicus. The twelfth thoracic is distributed to the abdominal wall and groin. [WP,unvetted]." [Wikipedia:Intercostal_nerves]

Shh expression is a prominent early feature of the caudal endoderm of the second arch, and individual pouches mark the anterior limits of expression of Hox genes within the pharyngeal endoderm; Hox-a2 has a rostral boundary at the second pouch, Hox-a3 at the third pouch and Hox-a4 at the most caudal pouch[PMID:16313389]

def: "The costocervical trunk arises from the upper and back part of the subclavian artery, behind the scalenus anterior on the right side, and medial to that muscle on the left side. Passing backward, it splits into the deep cervical artery and the supreme intercostal artery (or the Highest intercostal artery), which descends behind the pleura in front of the necks of the first and second ribs, and anastomoses with the first aortic intercostal (3rd posterior intercostal artery). As it crosses the neck of the first rib it lies medial to the anterior division of the first thoracic nerve, and lateral to the first thoracic ganglion of the sympathetic trunk. In the first intercostal space, it gives off a branch which is distributed in a manner similar to the distribution of the aortic intercostals. The branch for the second intercostal space usually joins with one from the highest aortic intercostal artery. This branch is not constant, but is more commonly found on the right side; when absent, its place is supplied by an intercostal branch from the aorta. Each intercostal gives off a posterior branch which goes to the posterior vertebral muscles, and sends a small spinal branch through the corresponding intervertebral foramen to the medulla spinalis and its membranes.

comment: Four classes of mineralized tissues are found in vertebrates: bone, cartilage, dentine, and enamel. We think of cartilage and bone as skeletal tissues and of enamel and dentine as dental tissues, but enamel and dentine arose evolutionarily together with bone as skeletal tissues in the dermal skeleton (exoskeleton) of early vertebrates. Scales and teeth of sharks are examples of dermal skeletal elements that are still composed of the three ancient components-enamel, dentine, and bone. Cartilage, on the other hand, provided the basis for the second vertebrate skeletal system, the endoskeleton (Smith and Hall, 1990; Hall, 1998a,b). some invertebrate skeletal tissues have surprisingly bone-like features. Examples include chondrocytes interconnected by cell processes in cephalopod cartilages (Cole and Hall, 2004a,b), and the calcium phosphate layer in the shells of brachiopods (Rodland et al., 2003). However, neither bone nor mineralized cartilage have been found in invertebrates. Editors notes: TODO - develops_from

name: non-neural ectoderm
comment: Gene notes: One of the first genes to be expressed in nonneural ectoderm in amphioxus is BMP2/4 (Panopoulou et al. 1998). BMP2/4 homologues appear to have a very ancient role in distinguishing neural from nonneural ectoderm; in Drosophila as well as in amphioxus and vertebrates, BMP2/4 homologues are expressed in nonneural ectoderm and function in distinguishing neural from nonneural ectoderm (Francois & Bier, 1995 ; Sasai et al. 1995 ; Wilson & Hemmati-Brivanlou, 1995; Panopoulou et al. 1998). A change in level of BMP2/4 from very high in nonneural ectoderm to low in neural ectoderm appears to be a key factor in development of neural crest (Baker & Bronner-Fraser,1997a,1997b;Erickson&Reedy,1998;Marchantet al.1998 ;Selleck et al. 1998).

def: "In the circulatory system of animals, a portal venous system occurs when a capillary bed drains into another capillary bed through veins, without first going through the heart. Both capillary beds and the blood vessels that connect them are considered part of the portal venous system. They are relatively uncommon as the majority of capillary beds drain into veins which then drain into the heart, not into another capillary bed. Portal venous systems are considered venous because the blood vessels that join the two capillary beds are either veins or venules. Examples of such systems include the hepatic portal system and the hypophyseal portal system. Unqualified, 'portal venous system' often refers to the hepatic portal system. For this reason, 'portal vein' most commonly refers to the hepatic portal vein[WP]." [Wikipedia:Portal_venous_system]

comment: The notochordal process grows cranially until it reaches the prechordal plate, the future site of the mouth. In this area the ectoderm is attached directly to the endoderm without intervening mesoderm. This area is known as the oropharyngeal membrane, and it will break down to become the mouth. At the other end of the primitive streak the ectoderm is also fused directly to the endoderm; this is known as the cloacal membrane (proctodeum), or primordial anus.

comment: The embryonic ventricle or primitive ventricle of the developing heart gives rise to the trabeculated parts of the left and right ventricles. In contrast, the smooth parts of the left and right ventricles originate from the embryological bulbus cordis. The primitive ventricle becomes divided by a septum, the septum inferius or ventricular septum, which grows upward from the lower part of the ventricle, its position being indicated on the surface of the heart by a furrow. Its dorsal part increases more rapidly than its ventral portion, and fuses with the dorsal part of the septum intermedium. For a time an interventricular foramen exists above its ventral portion, but this foramen is ultimately closed by the fusion of the aortic septum with the ventricular septum[WP]

def: "During the third week of embryological development there appears, immediately behind the ventral ends of the two halves of the mandibular arch, a rounded swelling named the tuberculum impar, which was described by His as undergoing enlargement to form the buccal part of the tongue. More recent researches, however, show that this part of the tongue is mainly, if not entirely, developed from a pair of lateral swellings which rise from the inner surface of the mandibular arch and meet in the middle line. The site of their meeting remains post-embryonically as the median sulcus of the tongue. The tuberculum impar is said to form the central part of the tongue immediately in front of the foramen cecum, but Hammar insists that it is purely a transitory structure and forms no part of the adult tongue[WP, Gray's]." [Wikipedia:Tuberculum_impar]
comment: The thyroid initially develops caudal to the tuberculum impar . This embryonic swelling arises from the first pharyngeal arch and occurs midline on the floor of the developing pharynx, eventually helping form the tongue as the 2 lateral lingual swellings overgrow it.

It consists of the clavicle and scapula in humans and, in those species with three bones in the pectoral girdle, the coracoid. Some mammalian species (e.g. the dog and the horse) have only the scapula. In humans, the only joints between the shoulder girdle and axial skeleton are the sternoclavicular joints on each side. No joint exists between each scapula and the rib cage; instead the muscular connection between the two permits relatively great mobility of the shoulder girdle in relation to the pelvic girdle. In those species having only the scapula, no joint exists between the forelimb and the thorax, the only attachment being muscular[WP]. Examples: There are only two instances, right and left pectoral girdle skeletons." [Wikipedia:Pectoral_girdle]

During gastrulation, the epiblast cells undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and delaminate to become the loose mesenchyme of the primitive streak. The epiblast is present in postimplantation mouse embryos between E5.5-E7.5.

def: "The hepatic artery proper (also proper hepatic artery), arises from the common hepatic artery and runs alongside the portal vein and the common bile duct to form the portal triad. The hepatic artery proper gives off a small supraduodenal artery to the duodenal bulb. Then the right gastric artery comes off and runs to the left along the lesser curvature of the stomach to meet the left gastric artery, which is a branch of the celiac trunk. It subsequently gives off the cystic artery, which feeds the gallbladder, before bifurcating into the right and left hepatic arteries. Of note, the right and left hepatic arteries may demonstrate variant anatomy. A replaced right hepatic artery may arise from the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and a replaced left hepatic artery may arise from the left gastric artery." [Wikipedia:Hepatic_artery_proper]

def: "The spinal accessory nucleus lies within the cervical spinal cord (C1-C5) in the ventral horn. The nucleus ambiguus is classically said to provide the 'cranial component' of the accessory nerve. However, the very existence of this cranial component has been recently questioned and seen as contributing exclusively to the vagus nerve. The terminology continues to be used in describing both human anatomy, and that of other animals." [Wikipedia:Spinal_accessory_nucleus]

It ascends between the bone, and substance of the Temporalis muscle, pierces the temporal fascia about 2.5 cm. above the zygomatic arch, and is distributed to the skin of the side of the forehead, and communicates with the facial nerve and with the auriculotemporal branch of the mandibular nerve. As it pierces the temporal fascia, it gives off a slender twig, which runs between the two layers of the fascia to the lateral angle of the orbit." [Wikipedia:Zygomaticotemporal_nerve]
